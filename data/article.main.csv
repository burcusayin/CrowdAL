For example, you misinterpreting my freedom of speech as being ``incivil`` is not an appropriate thing for an admin to do. You threatening to block me for reminding you of your ``mortality`` is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do. Your statements regarding the WikiProject Hawaii Manual of Style are WAY OFF. You need to take a truth pill, man. There is no violation in editing an article when it specifically invites users to edit it. Have you even looked at it? It's not even an ``article``. It's a mere ``stub``. It's history page had only one entry before I contributed. Nobody has touched that stub in over 7 months. You said I ``changed it completely``. That's FALSE. Making FALSE statements is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do. I did NOTHING that ``goes against the manual of style that was there``. There is NOTHING there that says don't make changes. There is NOTHING at WikiProject Hawaii requiring ``a survey``. There has been NO TALK AT ALL on that MoS since the STUB was created. It's been DEAD, with NO CONTRIBUTIONS, and NO USER INTEREST, for over 7 months. And now you criticize me for participating as a member of the Wikipedia community, and as an expert on the Hawaiian language, for making a positive contribution and bringing some LIFE to a dead, neglected stub? You need to review what Wikipedia is about. It's not about treating admins as a superior race. Admins are subject to the same rules as users. Even the President of the USA is just a man, Ryulong.

There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic.

It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as ``Brandenburg``, ``Saxony``, ``Hanover`` etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like ``Hanoverian`` and ``Bavarian`` no longer refer to national identities because they're all just ``German`` or ``Deutsch``. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture ``Bavarian`` ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name ``Macedonia``, except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context.......

article,2006,dev,0.1,37144574,blocked,"`IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article that is basically claiming that Kurds are closer to Jewish populations than Iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==`",,1.0,,False,0,False,True,1,False,0,0.1,0.0,426,0.0,0-1,1,0.0,b9e89c45-84ae-f8fe-d031-08a3906060c1,0-1,1707,689,1574687781392,,"{""30818245"":14,""37144574"":19,""65464049"":25}",,1,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-25T13:17:20.673Z""}]",2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddbd422b918b9011e15aef5,000084cc4d--5ddbd422b918b9011e15aef5,6b576cff0d0e1856f3bfdb04668441cc,APPROVED,2019-11-25T13:16:18.970,2019-11-25T13:17:21.267,2019-11-25T13:17:21.267,0.09,8703053,article,19.873,,19.873,3,0,True,4,19

Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.

article,2006,dev,0.1,37144574,blocked,"`IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians.

Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

I was accused for years of having sock puppets.

Well, a simple comparison of two pages of the RFA's I and he voted on can be done, and it can be seen that his claim there were multiple RFA's the two accounts voted on is false, or that Me and Mr. KIA ever voted on the same RFA ever, not even one, never mind the multiple he said happened.  The rules say he had to post the links in the page, but since the links did not exist, since the charge was false, that didn't happen.  So they broke their own rules of prosecution, presenting no evidence, and then convicted me on a charge where anyone comparing two pages in the space of a minute can see is false.  Of course my pointing this out before the case was closed was completely ignored.  Basically, I followed the rules but they didn't like my politics so I was punished for that.

I was accused for years of having sock puppets.  As things went downhill here (or uphill from their perspective), they began checking into the accusations of the wing nuts that I had sock puppets, and repeatedly found nothing.  Finally, things degenerated to the point where David Gerard, who has checkuser privileges, claimed I was someone named .  I have no association with Mr. Know-It-All, but even that aside, there is no rule on Wikipedia that you can't have multiple accounts.  So he claimed we had voted on multiple RFA's together, and due to that I was put on probation.  Well, a simple comparison of two pages of the RFA's I and he voted on can be done, and it can be seen that his claim there were multiple RFA's the two accounts voted on is false, or that Me and Mr. KIA ever voted on the same RFA ever, not even one, never mind the multiple he said happened.  The rules say he had to post the links in the page, but since the links did not exist, since the charge was false, that didn't happen.  So they broke their own rules of prosecution, presenting no evidence, and then convicted me on a charge where anyone comparing two pages in the space of a minute can see is false.  Of course my pointing this out before the case was closed was completely ignored.  Basically, I followed the rules but they didn't like my politics so I was punished for that.

On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area.

I was accused for years of having sock puppets.

Finally, things degenerated to the point where David Gerard, who has checkuser privileges, claimed I was someone named .  I have no association with Mr. Know-It-All, but even that aside, there is no rule on Wikipedia that you can't have multiple accounts.  So he claimed we had voted on multiple RFA's together, and due to that I was put on probation.  Well, a simple comparison of two pages of the RFA's I and he voted on can be done, and it can be seen that his claim there were multiple RFA's the two accounts voted on is false, or that Me and Mr. KIA ever voted on the same RFA ever, not even one, never mind the multiple he said happened.  The rules say he had to post the links in the page, but since the links did not exist, since the charge was false, that didn't happen.  So they broke their own rules of prosecution, presenting no evidence, and then convicted me on a charge where anyone comparing two pages in the space of a minute can see is false.  Of course my pointing this out before the case was closed was completely ignored.  Basically, I followed the rules but they didn't like my politics so I was punished for that.

The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this.

Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section areNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee NEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissedNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.

On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area.

The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is totally UNACCEPTAB_TOKENLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on ``North Nicosia`` that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

article,2005,train,0.1,24749800,blocked,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced. Also, the statement ``its following is small to the point of non-existence`` needs to be based on fact not fancy.

THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFemale masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.NEWLINE_TOKENLubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.NEWLINE_TOKENWomen may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ``hump`` the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.NEWLINE_TOKENSome reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENA few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.NEWLINE_TOKENThose who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before `",,1.0,,True,1,True,True,1,False,0,0.2,0.1,488,0.1,1-1,1,0.5,a5281d90-da13-a50d-643d-3d7451218eb3,x-x,1600,666,1574690772303,,"{""58852242"":10,""154607001"":10,""621675306"":4}",,0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-25T14:07:09.885Z""}]",7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddbdfd2538f39011e9e054f,000084cc4d--5ddbdfd2538f39011e9e054f,008fa5881540e0996db93c160f17ab7e,APPROVED,2019-11-25T14:06:10.941,2019-11-25T14:07:12.006,2019-11-25T14:07:12.006,0.09,8703053,article,11.35,,11.35,3,0,False,4,10

Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings.

On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area.

I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser.

I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.

Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

Since, I am leaving for vacation tomorrow morning, I was going to go in and vandalize your pages just before I left, you two were pissing me off so I just gave it away early that I was making a fool out of you two. Basically because you two are so damned gullible and got in some of my other enemies on it, Charlesknight and MathewFenton, I amde a fool out of them two. Anyways, I had some extra editing to do on the pages I liked so I came and made those edits. I really don't need to come here much as there isn't really anything I am interested in. However, when I want to come back after I come back from my vacation, I can do that very easily. Anyway, later suckers. Oh by the way YANDMAN, I love you. lol you dumbass. And Hybrid, you're sweet. LOL, You gullible fatass! Yandman thinks I don't have a static IP address. I am thinking about unhooking it tonight just to come back here tomorrow and vandalize his page to show him what a dumbass he is and how I can come back whenever I feel liek it.

Turley said, ``There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that ``Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . .

Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is ``not a Church commission``; ``The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs.`` Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books.

He reverted an edit of mine (even though it fit the subject), so I decided to leave a message on his user talk page.

It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as ``Brandenburg``, ``Saxony``, ``Hanover`` etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like ``Hanoverian`` and ``Bavarian`` no longer refer to national identities because they're all just ``German`` or ``Deutsch``. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture ``Bavarian`` ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name ``Macedonia``, except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context.......

article,2006,train,0.11111111109999999,88592890,blocked,"`::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Part of the problem may be that ``nationalist`` in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead ``patriotic`` does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish ``patria`` (fatherland), ``patriota`` and ``patriótico`` are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves ``patriotas`` in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of ``abertzale`` but ``nationalists``. On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against ``excessive`` decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Whatever the case, the term ``unionist`` seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is ``Spanish nationalist`` as more precise term, ``unionist`` is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I'd really like to hear from Mountolive.

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, ``independecne`` and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under ``deliberate discrimination``.

But the nature of terrorism is that it relies on people not realising that they will die anyway, with probability 1; and the chances of getting struck by lightning are literally higher than dying from terrorism. But guess which one has the press and the politicians acting on it? Not lightning. That's the real point isn't it? `` That is a ridiculous point. There is no War on Lightning simply because there are more deaths caused by lightning strikes that happen about by natural causes.

You can try to ``prove`` it with all the shoddy evidence you have that probably points to other things, that you try and twist to fit the picture that it was about oil. The war was about upholding UN Resolutions dealing with Saddam Hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. The onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply.

The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced.

article,2005,train,0.0,23763522,blocked,"`. NEWLINE_TOKENWhy would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better. Alright so Mace was duped, but Samuel was obviously pacified. Di Mace still make an impact? In a way, he did.

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with ``Vost``, ``ElliotJoyce``, or ``Accreditor``, and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started.

Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be ``The people of the Sunnah``. Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010).

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that.

Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be ``The people of the Sunnah``. Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?`",,1.0,,False,0,False,False,0,False,0,0.0,0.0,446,0.0,0-0,1,0.1,48cc62dc-9ef8-6479-54e2-12a77d3cc4cd,x-x,1518,650,1574793004900,,"{""317245857"":27,""371415763"":18,""496242888"":19}",,1,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-26T18:31:12.456Z""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddd6f2e2f3cb8011c2fa015,000084cc4d--5ddd6f2e2f3cb8011c2fa015,f1f29ca907933bdeb3b27299b92dcce2,APPROVED,2019-11-26T18:30:06.455,2019-11-26T18:31:17.508,2019-11-26T18:31:17.508,0.09,8703053,article,17.639,,17.639,2,0,False,2,18

Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be ``The people of the Sunnah``. Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010).

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp?

Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that.

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem?

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. NEWLINE_TOKENFor me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.NEWLINE_TOKEN* History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!NEWLINE_TOKEN* One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN ",,1.0,,False,0,True,False,0,False,0,0.11111111109999999,0.0,519,0.0,0-0,1,0.0,9009f8cb-354d-eadd-dafc-a883b20a4d38,0-0,1366,545,1574795616945,,"{""17856960"":11,""32236434"":25,""507846018"":0}",,0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:14:38.184Z""},{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:14:48.022Z""}]",9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddd79609bdc280121807c6f,000084cc4d--5ddd79609bdc280121807c6f,403e1b9bf3ba62fa4b85889f9b92132f,APPROVED,2019-11-26T19:13:36.180,2019-11-26T19:16:00.220,2019-11-26T19:16:00.220,0.09,8703053,article,71.077,,71.077,1,0,True,2,25

The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOption 2NEWLINE_TOKENIn a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction.

I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCertain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.

(He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice.

Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`",,1.0,,False,0,False,True,1,False,0,0.0,0.1,522,0.0,0-1,1,0.0,104b90a2-9380-98de-639a-bbb3c561c166,0-1,1610,1320,1574796373352,,"{""10574791"":94,""32984901"":40,""73770737"":29}",,maybe,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:27:08.730Z""},{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:28:52.796Z""}]",28.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddd7c51e5ae53011e1c1f4f,000084cc4d--5ddd7c51e5ae53011e1c1f4f,4213cc8f4b90a9d4288c194f50ded51e,APPROVED,2019-11-26T19:26:09.541,2019-11-26T19:28:53.306,2019-11-26T19:28:53.306,0.09,8703053,article,16.052,,16.052,5,0,True,6,40

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.  You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us, we are simply acting on requests of the industry. You are apparently some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

(He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`",,1.0,,False,0,False,True,1,False,0,0.0,0.1,522,0.0,0-1,1,0.0,c9770d7c-2f31-4869-b8f4-1f7ae480156d,0-1,1280,545,1574796451925,,"{""10574791"":0,""32984901"":0,""627542186"":45}",,1,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:29:47.572Z""}]",16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddd7cabb59afa012196ad6b,000084cc4d--5ddd7cabb59afa012196ad6b,7f956e6b4dee27c89e853c516620fc10,APPROVED,2019-11-26T19:27:39.397,2019-11-26T19:30:05.569,2019-11-26T19:30:05.569,0.09,8703053,article,101.019,,101.019,3,0,True,3,0

The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.NEWLINE_TOKENIf you truly object to editors ``fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,`` then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you.

At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENI strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.NEWLINE_TOKENI am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf.

Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice.

Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`",,1.0,,False,0,False,True,1,False,0,0.0,0.1,522,0.0,0-1,1,0.0,36d25a67-e965-db82-e1c0-df2a743ac876,x-x,360,560,1574797433628,,"{""10574791"":12,""14559217"":11,""32984901"":42}",,0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-26T19:45:19.584Z""}]",16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8703053/000084cc4d--5ddd804f6b52da012120db6d,000084cc4d--5ddd804f6b52da012120db6d,9206feb9a6b3bed42f33b9ab7e9aeaa5,APPROVED,2019-11-26T19:43:11.412,2019-11-26T19:45:00.345,2019-11-26T19:45:00.345,0.09,8703053,article,52.433,,52.433,1,0,False,1,42

At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENI strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks.

The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.NEWLINE_TOKENIf you truly object to editors ``fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,`` then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you.

At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENI strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks.

I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.NEWLINE_TOKENI am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf.

First, there isn't a single other case of false attribution, mistaken or otherwise, that's ever been made out against EPO that I can recall.

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

Serbs were a docile folk who, essentially, didn't fight ``their place under the sun``. Their very name signified servitude of a sort, as evidenced by the DAI's etymology.

They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question.

I intend to rewrite that section, is there a way I could get a list of links to articles you've written, either on fox or elsewhere? The fact that you have dropped some entries on Fox's blog should probably stay in there, but just as a note and the section as a whole, including the title, should probably focus on your career as a journalist. Second, I didn't quite understand ``The lede says I'm an ``embed on assignment in Iraq``. I've spent just as much time in Iraq.`` Could you possibly explain what you meant there?
