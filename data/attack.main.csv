article,2005,train,0.1,24749800,blocked,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced. Also, the statement ``its following is small to the point of non-existence`` needs to be based on fact not fancy.

Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.

Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::6.

Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`",,1.0,,False,0,False,True,1,False,0,0.0,0.1,522,0.0,0-1,1,0.0,9cf2ca0b-f972-16bd-874f-20f14b2e7cd4,0-1,1366,577,1574687677430,,"{""32984901"":0,""35445625"":2,""309639840"":1}",0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-25T13:14:40.812Z""}]",,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8702893/000084cbad--5ddbd3559a4ea101200e9fe2,000084cbad--5ddbd3559a4ea101200e9fe2,06c837e043ce88c489d419c70b4e51df,APPROVED,2019-11-25T13:12:53.593,2019-11-25T13:14:47.580,2019-11-25T13:14:47.580,0.09,8702893,attack,3.382,3.382,,1,0,True,1,0

Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate.

The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOption 2NEWLINE_TOKENIn a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction.

article,2006,train,0.11111111109999999,88592890,blocked,"`::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Part of the problem may be that ``nationalist`` in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead ``patriotic`` does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish ``patria`` (fatherland), ``patriota`` and ``patriótico`` are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves ``patriotas`` in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of ``abertzale`` but ``nationalists``. On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself.

Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings.

I had said the conversation is concluded - it is Jack who isn't letting it go by going to admins and other editors.  I have “cooled off” (I was only hot for a moment) – and I MUST express myself on my own Talk page. Is this language-censorship? What is it? Jack Forbes gave as good as he got – and my point about him stands. Are you green-lighting Jack Forbes in a general sense ? (and why get involved?) I do need to know this now, as my time is valuable to me: I am questioning why I am on Wikipedia every day at the moment: it has to make sense to me.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Actually don't bother: when I look at your opening line ``you've been warned time and again for incivility, personal attacks, edit warring, etc.`` (``etc`` for heaven's sake?

Less than 50% of admins seem to be up to the job, and unfortunately I always feel there should be more. Is worth me staying? Honestly - No. I could appeal yes, but what's the point?: Wikipedia has got to the hysterical point where editing is too-often seen as a crime (and a mark against your name), any old joe can throw around official-looking warnings (do you see me doing it?), too-busy admins simply head-count everything, and incidents are not treated on merit, but on a perceived ``reputation``. Name a developed country that works like that? It is a catch I can't see myself getting out of. I have a lot I still planned to do, but I can't see the merit in staying: Wikipedia has vast power and needs value-driven guideline-obeying people like myself - it is mainly the politicised who seem to understand the power of this place - but life is full of other things, and I can't see myself fitting in here anymore.

Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.

On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language.

Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section areNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee NEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissedNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThough it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the ``trailer-park trash`` comment.

Serbs were a docile folk who, essentially, didn't fight ``their place under the sun``. Their very name signified servitude of a sort, as evidenced by the DAI's etymology.

Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations.

Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section areNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee NEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissedNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThough it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the ``trailer-park trash`` comment.

The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus.

I have followed this whole case including the Arb where again you seem content to falsify history, this time claiming, 'the Gordian Knot was a greek mess solved by a Macedonian.' The Gordian Knot was not a Greek knot Taivo and I suggest you refer to the appropriate page on this encylopedia to understand why before misquoting history. Alexander the Great, a Greek in his own words unfortunately for your little example on the Arb page, solved the knot the same way Chris0 did, without a care and with the sword. It is offensive enough how bias you are on the whole issue while claiming neutrality (the only thing that really annoys me), at least Fut Perfect and Chris 0 are honest extreme nationalists to an extent. What exactly are you? It is sad in my view. This page has always been a battle ground, on the one hand, the usual Greeks editors tring to salvage their past for the world to remember them by, on the other the new fierce 'Macedonians' relying on neurtrals who do not fully understand the situation in the Balkans for support. This word Macedonia, clearly needs a disamiguation page as Michael Wood (historian) would argue as he believes, the Republic of Macedonia should not be confused with the word Macedonia, and Taivo, I feel with great assurance, he does know his history and politics on the matter.

Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' ``talk page`` on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether.

He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself ``SwatJester``.

Do we just go ahead and execute people based on ``alleged verbals``??? And please explain Purrums, why Grindlay didn't go directly to the authorities to make an official report of Ryan's ``alleged verbal`` confession? After all, Grindlay was the top-notch man at Pentridge and he surely would called a special meeting to report and discuss such an amazing verbal confession to inform government leaders, prison authorities, televison, radio and other media journalists from around Australia, prosecutors and defence laywers, Father Brosnan and et al. Why would Ryan confess to Grindlay while at the eleventh-hour Ryan wrote letters to various people protesting his innocence? Ryan had to write his letters on toilet paper and then he was also refused his right to make a ``last statement`` just prior to execution. Smells fishy to me! The various documentary films, based on meticulous research including archival material and interviews by living people (including Grindlay) who were directly involved in the Ryan case do not even mention such a confession taking place - because it didn't happen! Professional film-makers know better than to make false allegations, which can result in being sued for compensation of millions of dollars. Documentary films are based on facts and truth.

These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians.

Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on.

Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be ``The people of the Sunnah``. Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010).

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, ``independecne`` and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under ``deliberate discrimination``. There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

I was accused for years of having sock puppets.

article,2005,train,0.0,23763522,blocked,"`. NEWLINE_TOKENWhy would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better. Alright so Mace was duped, but Samuel was obviously pacified. Di Mace still make an impact? In a way, he did.

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, ``independecne`` and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under ``deliberate discrimination``. There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

The war was about upholding UN Resolutions dealing with Saddam Hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. The onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply. The only thing that terrorism had to do with Iraq was that Saddam had ties to terrorism and could employ the use of terror if he was desperate. The case for the removal of Hussien was being discussed even in the Clinton administration. NEWLINE_TOKEN This situation is so easy to comprehend.

It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as ``Brandenburg``, ``Saxony``, ``Hanover`` etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like ``Hanoverian`` and ``Bavarian`` no longer refer to national identities because they're all just ``German`` or ``Deutsch``. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture ``Bavarian`` ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name ``Macedonia``, except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context.......

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

article,2005,train,0.1,24749800,blocked,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced. Also, the statement ``its following is small to the point of non-existence`` needs to be based on fact not fancy.

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with ``Vost``, ``ElliotJoyce``, or ``Accreditor``, and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started.

I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as ``Brandenburg``, ``Saxony``, ``Hanover`` etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like ``Hanoverian`` and ``Bavarian`` no longer refer to national identities because they're all just ``German`` or ``Deutsch``. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture ``Bavarian`` ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries.

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to ``jult.net``, not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to ``spam``.NEWLINE_TOKENBeing able to use your admin-tools does not mean you need to abuse people on Wikipedia.

I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article.

THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFemale masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.NEWLINE_TOKENLubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.NEWLINE_TOKENWomen may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ``hump`` the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.NEWLINE_TOKENSome reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENA few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.NEWLINE_TOKENThose who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation.

You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in ``chat-rooms`` and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical ``angry`` way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFemale masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.NEWLINE_TOKENLubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.NEWLINE_TOKENWomen may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ``hump`` the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.NEWLINE_TOKENSome reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENA few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.NEWLINE_TOKENThose who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation.

THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFemale masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.NEWLINE_TOKENLubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.NEWLINE_TOKENWomen may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ``hump`` the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.NEWLINE_TOKENSome reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.NEWLINE_TOKENA few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.NEWLINE_TOKENThose who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation.

It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as ``Brandenburg``, ``Saxony``, ``Hanover`` etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like ``Hanoverian`` and ``Bavarian`` no longer refer to national identities because they're all just ``German`` or ``Deutsch``. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture ``Bavarian`` ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries.

I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty.

Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so?

I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?

Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that.

But even a cynic like yourself must concede that it was probably an honest mistake.  First, there isn't a single other case of false attribution, mistaken or otherwise, that's ever been made out against EPO that I can recall.  John and Jean-Michel who've done most, if not all, the work have been meticulous throughout.  Plus, they have openly invited corrections if and when any mistakes were noted.  This is an opportunity for you, then, to make EPO even better.

It is just that.  The only error is that the quotes are in the section of Rawat's own quotes and not the more general category of all quotes of interest.  In other words a simple mistake just like you said. On the other hand, you also make accusations of quotes ``out of context``.  You have offered no support at all for this accusation.  It's time you did or gave up that scurrilous accusation. On that score, you also alleged that the editors of the above book themselves wrote some of the quotes in question.

article,2006,dev,0.1,37144574,blocked,"`IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population.

None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing.

Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals.NEWLINE_TOKENWhy would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder`` In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death.

With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that.

But this nun was not a psychologist, so how could she possibly come to that conclusion?  NEWLINE_TOKENObviously, it seems Ryan's execution was more of a state-assisted suicide. NEWLINE_TOKENIn relation to this alleged confession, Ryan didn't actually say he shot Hodson, but allegedly, said he shot to wing not to kill. Ryan,  obviously in an extremely confused mental state, (as any person would be prior to being killed by the Government), could have been talking about his past kangaroo shooting events or any other event for that matter. After all, a mentally confused person does not talk in a rational manner. NEWLINE_TOKENBesides, nobody else close to Ryan claimed he no longer wanted to live. None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing. In any case, any person who states they no longer wish to live should be immediately evaluated for mental illness, So, why wasn't a psychiatrist called to treat Ryan for possible mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts? Why the push to execute Ryan if he was mentally unstable, hence, no longer wanted to live?NEWLINE_TOKENLegal professionals will confirm that alleged confessions and alleged verbals are not legally acceptable as ``evidence of guilt``. Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In Ryan's case there was none - nothing! To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals.NEWLINE_TOKENWhy would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder`` In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death.

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem?

He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european.

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so ``blessed`` as Americans.

There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population.

article,2006,dev,0.1,37144574,blocked,"`IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. NEWLINE_TOKEN0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in anyNEWLINE_TOKENradix system.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and rNEWLINE_TOKENsuch that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then NEWLINE_TOKENwhat are the integers q and r such that the above is true?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSuppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.NEWLINE_TOKENFor example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, theNEWLINE_TOKENdivision algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1=(0.999...)(0)+1.

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. NEWLINE_TOKENFor me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.NEWLINE_TOKEN* History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!NEWLINE_TOKEN* One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN ",,1.0,,False,0,True,False,0,False,0,0.11111111109999999,0.0,519,0.0,0-0,1,0.0,56987221-ecb3-0eae-e6e5-d095775952e1,x-x,1366,545,1574883972276,,"{""32236434"":25,""73770737"":3,""200770993"":20}",1,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-27T19:46:42.212Z""}]",,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8702893/000084cbad--5dded282e5ae53012007ccf8,000084cbad--5dded282e5ae53012007ccf8,ec837b3e8529a702bde83d8d64646ca6,APPROVED,2019-11-27T19:46:10.083,2019-11-27T19:47:09.412,2019-11-27T19:47:09.412,0.09,8702893,attack,29.936,29.936,,3,0,False,4,25

At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. NEWLINE_TOKENFor me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.NEWLINE_TOKEN* History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!NEWLINE_TOKEN* One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN ",,1.0,,False,0,True,False,0,False,0,0.11111111109999999,0.0,519,0.0,0-0,1,0.0,773b397c-8d69-df91-b73b-9b135e5eb964,0-0,1366,577,1574884347932,,"{""14559217"":96,""32236434"":176,""200770993"":136}",0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-27T19:57:06.519Z""}]",,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8702893/000084cbad--5dded337e5ae53012007d6ee,000084cbad--5dded337e5ae53012007d6ee,4fbd43e4194a8550670792df43bd3730,APPROVED,2019-11-27T19:49:11.956,2019-11-27T19:56:10.196,2019-11-27T19:56:10.196,0.09,8702893,attack,178.933,178.933,,6,0,True,6,176

First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books.

I have followed this whole case including the Arb where again you seem content to falsify history, this time claiming, 'the Gordian Knot was a greek mess solved by a Macedonian.' The Gordian Knot was not a Greek knot Taivo and I suggest you refer to the appropriate page on this encylopedia to understand why before misquoting history. Alexander the Great, a Greek in his own words unfortunately for your little example on the Arb page, solved the knot the same way Chris0 did, without a care and with the sword. It is offensive enough how bias you are on the whole issue while claiming neutrality (the only thing that really annoys me), at least Fut Perfect and Chris 0 are honest extreme nationalists to an extent. What exactly are you? It is sad in my view. This page has always been a battle ground, on the one hand, the usual Greeks editors tring to salvage their past for the world to remember them by, on the other the new fierce 'Macedonians' relying on neurtrals who do not fully understand the situation in the Balkans for support. This word Macedonia, clearly needs a disamiguation page as Michael Wood (historian) would argue as he believes, the Republic of Macedonia should not be confused with the word Macedonia, and Taivo, I feel with great assurance, he does know his history and politics on the matter.

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. NEWLINE_TOKENFor me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.NEWLINE_TOKEN* History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!NEWLINE_TOKEN* One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN ",,1.0,,False,0,True,False,0,False,0,0.11111111109999999,0.0,519,0.0,0-0,1,0.0,a2a4f1a9-5fb9-25ea-a9b3-8a1f038425bf,0-0,360,574,1574884686521,,"{""32236434"":39,""200770993"":1,""285243431"":1}",0,,,,"[{""time"":""2019-11-27T19:58:58.566Z""}]",,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/8702893/000084cbad--5dded54cdee305011f7da618,000084cbad--5dded54cdee305011f7da618,c229e466c26ff44669ae73d912261d9b,APPROVED,2019-11-27T19:58:04.586,2019-11-27T19:59:12.118,2019-11-27T19:59:12.118,0.09,8702893,attack,41.856,41.856,,3,0,True,3,39

The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide.
