22976384,Virtual-reality balance training with a video-game system improves dynamic balance in chronic stroke patients.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"Stroke is one of the most serious healthcare problems and a major cause of impairment of cognition and physical functions. Virtual rehabilitation approaches to postural control have been used for enhancing functional recovery that may lead to a decrease in the risk of falling. In the present study, we investigated the effects of virtual reality balance training (VRBT) with a balance board game system on balance of chronic stroke patients. Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups: VRBT group (11 subjects including 3 women, 65.26 years old) and control group (11 subjects including 5 women, 63.13 years old). Both groups participated in a standard rehabilitation program (physical and occupational therapy) for 60 min a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. In addition, the VRBT group participated in VRBT for 30 min a day, 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Static balance (postural sway velocity with eyes open or closed) was evaluated with the posturography. Dynamic balance was evaluated with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG) that measures balance and mobility in dynamic balance. There was greater improvement on BBS (4.00 vs. 2.81 scores) and TUG (-1.33 vs. -0.52 sec) in the VRBT group compared with the control group (P < 0.05), but not on static balance in both groups. In conclusion, we demonstrate a significant improvement in dynamic balance in chronic stroke patients with VRBT.

18667809,Virtual rehabilitation in an activity centre for community-dwelling persons with stroke. The possibilities of 3-dimensional computer games.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to place a virtual reality (VR) system, designed to assess and to promote motor performance in the affected upper extremity in subjects after stroke, in a nonhospital environment. We also wanted to investigate if playing computer games resulted in improved motor function in persons with prior stroke. METHODS: The intervention involved 11 patients after stroke who received extra rehabilitation by training on a computer 3 times a week during a 4-week period. The control group involved 11 patients after stroke who continued their previous rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period. The mean age of all was 68 years (range = 47-85) and the average time after stroke 66 months (range = 15-140). The VR training consisted of challenging games, which provided a range of difficulty levels that allow practice to be fun and motivating. An additional group of 11 right-handed aged matched individuals without history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses served as reference subjects. RESULTS: All the participants reported that they were novel computer game players. After an initial introduction they learned to use the VR system quickly. The treatment group demonstrated improvements in motor outcome for the trained upper extremity, but this was not detected in real-life activities. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this research suggest the usefulness of computer games in training motor performance. VR can be used beneficially not only by younger participants but also by older persons to enhance their motor performance after stroke. Copyright  2008 S.

DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: group A received cathodal tDCS, group B received VR, and group C received combination therapy (cathodal tDCS was simultaneously applied during VR therapy). SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=59) with impaired unilateral UE motor function after stroke. INTERVENTION: Fifteen sessions of treatment over a 3-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Modified Ashworth Scale, manual muscle test (MMT), Manual Function Test (MFT), Fugl-Meyer Scale (FMS), and Box and Block Test were used to assess UE function. To evaluate activities of daily living, the Korean-Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) was used. All outcomes were measured before and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, all groups demonstrated significant improvements in MMT, MFT, FMS, and K-MBI scores. The change in MFT and FMS scores was different between the 3 groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that the improvement of MFT and FMS scores in group C was significantly higher than those of the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the present pilot study, the combination of brain stimulation using tDCS and peripheral arm training using VR could facilitate a stronger beneficial effect on UE impairment than using each intervention alone.

It is unclear whether the cognitive benefit can be maximized by increasing the degree of mental challenge during exercise. This randomized clinical trial (RCT), the Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) sought to replicate and extend prior findings of added cognitive benefit from exergaming to those with or at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ACES compares the effects of 6 months of an exer-tour (virtual reality bike rides) with the effects of a more effortful exer-score (pedaling through a videogame to score points). Fourteen community-dwelling older adults meeting screening criteria for MCI (sMCI) were adherent to their assigned exercise for 6 months. The primary outcome was executive function, while secondary outcomes included memory and everyday cognitive function. Exer-tour and exer-score yielded significant moderate effects on executive function (Stroop A/C; d's = 0.51 and 0.47); there was no significant interaction effect. However, after 3 months the exer-tour revealed a significant and moderate effect, while exer-score showed little impact, as did a game-only condition. Both exer-tour and exer-score conditions also resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory. Effects appear to generalize to self-reported everyday cognitive function. Pilot data, including salivary biomarkers and structural MRI, were gathered at baseline and 6 months; exercise dose was associated with increased BDNF as well as increased gray matter volume in the PFC and ACC. Improvement in memory was associated with an increase in the DLPFC. Improved executive function was associated with increased expression of exosomal miRNA-9. Interactive physical and cognitive exercise (both high and low mental challenge) yielded similarly significant cognitive benefit for adherent sMCI exercisers over 6 months. A larger RCT is needed to confirm these findings. Further innovation and clinical trial data are needed to develop accessible, yet engaging and effective interventions to combat cognitive decline for the growing MCI population.

The purpose of this pilot randomized control study was to prospectively compare planar and functional ROM, compliance, pain, enjoyment, and exertion in pediatric burn patients receiving two types of rehabilitation therapy. Seventeen school-aged children with 31 affected limbs who demonstrated limited shoulder ROM from burn injury were randomized to receive exercises using either standard therapy ROM activities (ST) or interactive videogame therapy (VGT). Patients received 3 weeks of the designated therapy intervention twice daily. They were then given a corresponding home program of the same type of therapy to perform regularly for 6 months. Standard goniometry and three-dimensional motion analysis during functional tasks were used to assess ROM. Measures were taken at baseline, 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Pain was measured before and after each treatment session during the 3-week intervention. There was no difference in compliance, enjoyment, or exertion between the groups. Patients in both the ST and VGT groups showed significant improvement in shoulder flexion (P < .001), shoulder abduction (P <.001), shoulder external rotation (P = .01), and elbow flexion (P = .004) ROM from baseline to 6 months as measured with goniometry. Subjects also showed significant gains in elbow flexion (P = .04) during hand to head and shoulder flexion (P = .04) during high reach. There was no difference in ROM gains between the groups. Within group comparison showed that the VGT group had significantly more recovery of ROM during the first 3 weeks than any other timeframe in the study, whereas ST had most gains at 3 months. There was a significant difference between the groups in the subjects' pain response. ST subjects showed an increase in pain during the intervention, whereas VGT subjects did not (VGT: r = .047, ST: r = .18; P = .015). In this study, interactive videogames were equally effective as traditional therapy for overall ROM gains and resulted in quicker recovery of motion with less pain experienced. Such videogames are a useful adjunct to therapy and should be considered as part of a holistic approach to rehabilitation within the hospital and at home after discharge in pediatric patients recovering from burn injury.

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind phase III multicenter trial, 120 participants with upper extremity motor impairment within 12 weeks after stroke were consecutively included at 5 rehabilitation institutions. Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis.

22768793,"Reaching out, inviting back: using Interactive voice response (IVR) technology to recycle relapsed smokers back to Quitline treatment--a randomized controlled trial.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco dependence is a chronic, relapsing condition that typically requires multiple quit attempts and extended treatment. When offered the opportunity, relapsed smokers are interested in recycling back into treatment for a new, assisted quit attempt. This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of interactive voice response (IVR) in recycling low income smokers who had previously used quitline (QL) support back to QL support for a new quit attempt. METHODS: A sample of 2985 previous QL callers were randomized to either receive IVR screening for current smoking (control group) or IVR screening plus an IVR intervention. The IVR intervention consists of automated questions to identify and address barriers to re-cycling in QL support, followed by an offer to be transferred to the QL and reinitiate treatment. Re-enrollment in QL services for both groups was documented. RESULTS: The IVR system successfully reached 715 (23.9%) former QL participants. Of those, 27% (194/715) reported to the IVR system that they had quit smoking and were therefore excluded from the study and analysis. The trial's final sample was composed of 521 current smokers. The re-enrollment rate was 3.3% for the control group and 28.2% for the intervention group (p < .001). Logistic regression results indicated an 11.2 times higher odds for re-enrollment of the intervention group than the control group (p < .001). Results did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, or level of education, however recycled smokers were older (Mean = 45.2; SD = 11.7) than smokers who declined a new treatment cycle (Mean = 41.8; SD = 13.2); (p = 0.013). The main barriers reported for not engaging in a new treatment cycle were low self-efficacy and lack of interest in quitting. After delivering IVR messages targeting these reported barriers, 32% of the smokers reporting low self-efficacy and 4.8% of those reporting lack of interest in quitting re-engaged in a new QL treatment cycle. CONCLUSION: Proactive IVR outreach is a promising tool to engage low income, relapsed smokers back into a new cycle of treatment. Integration of IVR intervention for recycling smokers with previous QL treatment has the potential to decrease tobacco-related disparities.

However, it is not known which of the three types of exercises provide the best effects on physical and cognitive status, and which exercise is preferred by older persons. This study compared the effects of PE, VRE, and BE on balance, muscle strength, cognition, and fall concern. In addition, exercise effort perception and contentment in older persons was evaluated. Methods: Eighty-four older persons (n = 84) were randomly selected for PE, VRE, BE, and control groups. The exercise groups received 8-week training, whereas the control group did not. Balance was assessed by Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG), muscle strength by 5 Times Sit to Stand (5TSTS) and left and right hand grip strength (HGS), cognition by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Timed Up and Go test Cognition (TUG-cog), fall concern by Fall Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), exercise effort perception by Borg category ratio scale (Borg CR-10), and exercise contentment by a questionnaire. Results: After exercise, PE significantly enhanced TUG and 5TSTS to a greater extent than VRE (TUG; p = 0.004, 5TSTS; p = 0.027) and BE (TUG; p = 0,012, 5TSTS; p < 0.001). VRE significantly improved MoCA (p < 0.001) and FES-I (p = 0.036) compared to PE, and 5TSTS (p < 0.001) and FES-I (p = 0.011) were improved relative to BE. MoCA was significantly enhanced by BE compared to PE (p < 0.001) and both MoCA and TUG-cog were improved compared to VRE (p = 0.04). PE and VRE significantly (p < 0.001) increased Borg CR-10 in all exercise sessions, whereas BE showed a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the first 4 sessions. Participants had a significantly greater satisfaction with BE than controls (p = 0.006), and enjoyed VRE and BE more than PE (p < 0.001). Subjects in all exercise groups exhibited benefits compared to the control group (p < 0.001).

1003,Effects of substituting a portion of standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors,howard-2017,1,1.0,,"Background. Evidence indicates that the continuation of therapy among community-dwelling stroke survivors improves physical function. Community rehabilitation programmes often face limitations in terms of resources. It is imperative to include new motivational interventions to encourage some level of non-clinician management. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any changes in physical function and activities of daily living when substituting a portion of the standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors. Methods. In this controlled trial, the experimental group received 30 minutes of virtual reality balance games in addition to 90 minutes of standard physiotherapy. The control group continued with their two hours of routine standard physiotherapy. Both groups received 12 therapy sessions: two-hour sessions twice per week for six continuous weeks. Changes in physical function, activities of daily living and balance ability were assessed using the Timed Up and Go test, 30-second Sit to Stand test, Timed Ten-Metre Walk test, Six-Minute Walk test and the Barthel Index, and static balance was assessed using a probalance board. Results. Twenty-eight participants completed post-intervention assessments. The results showed a significant within-subject effect on the Timed Up and Go test: F (1, 26) = 5.83, p = 0.02; and the 30-second Sit to Stand test; F (1, 26) = 13.50, p = 0.001. The between-subject effect was not significant (p > 0.05) for any of the outcome measurements. Conclusion. Substituting a portion of the standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games was equally effective in maintaining physical function outcomes and activities of daily living among community-dwelling stroke survivors.

Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis. CONCLUSIONS: Additional upper extremity VR training was not superior but equally as effective as additional CT in the subacute phase after stroke. VR may constitute a motivating training alternative as a supplement to standard rehabilitation. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02079103.

19692911,The effect of virtual reality on pain and range of motion in adults with burn injuries.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"Few studies have empirically investigated the effects of immersive virtual reality (VR) on postburn physical therapy pain control and range of motion (ROM). We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study of the effects of adding VR to standard therapy in adults receiving active-assisted ROM physical therapy, by assessing pain scores and maximal joint ROM immediately before and after therapy on two consecutive days. Thirty-nine inpatients, aged 21 to 57 years (mean 35 years), with a mean TBSA burn of 18% (range, 3-60%) were studied using a within-subject, crossover design. All patients received their regular pretherapy pharmacologic analgesia regimen. During physical therapy sessions on two consecutive days (VR one day and no VR the other day; order randomized), each patient participated in active-assisted ROM exercises with an occupational or physical therapist. At the conclusion of each session, patients provided 0 to 100 Graphic Rating Scale measurements of pain after each 10-minute treatment condition. On the day with VR, patients wore a head-position-tracked, medical care environment-excluding VR helmet with stereophonic sound and interacted in a virtual environment conducive to burn care. ROM measurements for each joint exercised were recorded before and after each therapy session. Because of nonsignificant carryover and order effects, the data were analyzed using simple paired t-tests. VR reduced all Graphic Rating Scale pain scores (worst pain, time spent thinking about the pain, and pain unpleasantness by 27, 37, and 31% respectively), relative to the no VR condition. Average ROM improvement was slightly greater with the VR condition; however, this difference failed to reach clinical or statistical significance (P = .243). Ninety-seven percent of patients reported zero to mild nausea after the VR session. Immersive VR effectively reduced pain and did not impair ROM during postburn physical therapy.

23841967,Neural reorganization accompanying upper limb motor rehabilitation from stroke with virtual reality-based gesture therapy.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Gesture Therapy is an upper limb virtual reality rehabilitation-based therapy for stroke survivors. It promotes motor rehabilitation by challenging patients with simple computer games representative of daily activities for self-support. This therapy has demonstrated clinical value, but the underlying functional neural reorganization changes associated with this therapy that are responsible for the behavioral improvements are not yet known. OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantify the occurrence of neural reorganization strategies that underlie motor improvements as they occur during the practice of Gesture Therapy and to identify those strategies linked to a better prognosis. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroscans were longitudinally collected at 4 time points during Gesture Therapy administration to 8 patients. Behavioral improvements were monitored using the Fugl-Meyer scale and Motricity Index. Activation loci were anatomically labelled and translated to reorganization strategies. Strategies are quantified by counting the number of active clusters in brain regions tied to them. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated significant behavioral improvements (P < .05). Contralesional activation of the unaffected motor cortex, cerebellar recruitment, and compensatory prefrontal cortex activation were the most prominent strategies evoked. A strong and significant correlation between motor dexterity upon commencing therapy and total recruited activity was found (r2 = 0.80; P < .05), and overall brain activity during therapy was inversely related to normalized behavioral improvements (r2 = 0.64; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Prefrontal cortex and cerebellar activity are the driving forces of the recovery associated with Gesture Therapy.

30782127,The (cost-) effectiveness of exergaming in people living with dementia and their informal caregivers: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is linked to benefits such as increased physical fitness, cognition, emotional and social functioning, general health and well-being in older people. Some evidence suggests that this also applies to people living with dementia. However, it can be harder for them to perform physical activities, due to several barriers, such as issues with orientation and balance problems. A relatively new type of physical activity called exergaming may help them overcome these barriers. Exergaming is physical exercise interactively combined with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exergaming compared to regular activities in people living with dementia, who attend day-care centres. Additionally, we want to investigate whether the exergaming activity for the person living with dementia, also (indirectly) affects the informal caregiver, as well as which facilitators and barriers to implementation of exergames for this target group exist. METHODS: A cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), with economic and process evaluations alongside will be carried out. In the Netherlands, 24 day-care centres are randomized in the experimental or control group. The study group will consist of 224 dyads (community-dwelling participants with dementia and their informal caregivers), who are interviewed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The participant with dementia has to visit the day-care centre for at least two days per week, have a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia and have an informal caregiver present, who is willing to participate. Societal cost data will be collected during interviews, using healthcare utilization diaries, and from day-care centres. The process evaluation will only involve the experimental group, and will include an online survey, qualitative interviews and focus groups. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to the evidence base that more effective exercise among people with dementia will result in positive effects on their wellbeing and quality of life. This will motivate people with dementia to be physically active. We also envision that there might be a positive effect on the burden of care experienced by their informal caregivers.

25842051,Effectiveness of conventional versus virtual reality-based balance exercises in vestibular rehabilitation for unilateral peripheral vestibular loss: results of a randomized controlled trial.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of virtual reality-based balance exercises to conventional balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular loss (UVL). DESIGN: Assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two acute care university teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with UVL (N=71) who had dizziness/vertigo, and gait and balance impairment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with UVL were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of either conventional (n=36) or virtual reality-based (n=35) balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation. The virtual reality-based group received an off-the-shelf virtual reality gaming system for home exercise, and the conventional group received a foam balance mat. Treatment comprised weekly visits to a physiotherapist and a daily home exercise program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-preferred gait speed. Secondary outcomes included other gait parameters and tasks, Sensory Organization Test (SOT), dynamic visual acuity, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefits Questionnaire, and Activities Balance Confidence Questionnaire. The subjective experience of vestibular rehabilitation was measured with a questionnaire. RESULTS: Both groups improved, but there were no significant differences in gait speed between the groups postintervention (mean difference, -.03m/s; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.09 to .02m/s). There were also no significant differences between the groups in SOT scores (mean difference, .82%; 95% CI, -5.00% to 6.63%) or on any of the other secondary outcomes (P>.05). In both groups, adherence to exercise was high (∼77%), but the virtual reality-based group reported significantly more enjoyment (P=.001), less difficulty with (P=.009) and less tiredness after (P=.03) balance exercises. At 6 months, there were no significant between-group differences in physical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality-based balance exercises performed during vestibular rehabilitation were not superior to conventional balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation but may provide a more enjoyable method of retraining balance after unilateral peripheral vestibular loss.

Therefore, we developed RehabMaster���, a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. METHODS: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded. RESULTS: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P = .03) and MBI (P = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (P = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI.

23388087,V-TIME: a treadmill training program augmented by virtual reality to decrease fall risk in older adults: study design of a randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Recent work has demonstrated that fall risk can be attributed to cognitive as well as motor deficits. Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk. METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred older adults with a history of falls will be recruited to participate in this study. This will include older adults (n=100), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n=100), and patients with Parkinson's disease (n=100). These three sub-groups will be recruited in order to evaluate the effects of the intervention in people with a range of motor and cognitive deficits. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (treadmill training with virtual reality) or to the active-control group (treadmill training without virtual reality). Each person will participate in a training program set in an outpatient setting 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Assessments will take place before, after, and 1 month and 6 months after the completion of the training. A falls calendar will be kept by each participant for 6 months after completing the training to assess fall incidence (i.e., the number of falls, multiple falls and falls rate). In addition, we will measure gait under usual and dual task conditions, balance, community mobility, health related quality of life, user satisfaction and cognitive function. DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial will demonstrate the extent to which an intervention that combines treadmill training augmented by virtual reality reduces fall risk, improves mobility and enhances cognitive function in a diverse group of older adults. In addition, the comparison to an active control group that undergoes treadmill training without virtual reality will provide evidence as to the added value of addressing motor cognitive interactions as an integrated unit.

15689053,Concomitant use of policosanol and beta-blockers in older patients.,vazquez-2018,0,1.0,,"Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. It is safe and well tolerated, even in populations with high consumption of concomitant drugs. These data suggest that adverse events (AE) due to drug-to-drug interactions (DDI) with policosanol are not relevant. Experimental data indicate that potential DDI between policosanol and drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 hepatic system are not expected, but pharmacodynamic DDI cannot be excluded. Several clinical studies have shown that policosanol decreased arterial pressure compared with placebo, and a pharmacological interaction with beta-blockers was experimentally proven. Therefore, clinical DDI between policosanol and beta-blockers can be expected. This study investigated whether policosanol reinforces the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers and/or whether this combination impairs some safety indicators or induces specific AE in older patients. After 5 weeks on a diet-only baseline period, 205 older hypercholesterolemic patients taking beta-blockers were randomized to policosanol 5 mg/day or placebo for 3 years. After 1 year on therapy, policosanol significantly reduced (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (20.9%), total cholesterol (TC) (19.3%) and triglycerides (TG) (25.7%), whereas it increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus placebo) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (4.1%). Treatment effects did not to wear off during the 3-year follow-up. At study completion, policosanol lowered (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) LDL-C (34.3%), TC (23.2%) and TG (21.2%) and raised (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) HDL-C (12.3%). Thirty-one patients (15.1%) discontinued the study, 22 in the placebo group (20.6%) and nine in the policosanol group (9.2%). Of these, 20 patients (16 in the placebo group and four in the policosanol group) withdrew from the study due to AE. The frequency of serious adverse events (SAE), mostly vascular, in policosanol patients (3/98, 3.1%) was lower than in the placebo group (15/107, 14.0%). No impairment of safety indicators was observed. Nevertheless, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in policosanol patients compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of policosanol patients reporting mild or moderate AE (18/98, 18.4%) was also lower than in the placebo group (30/107, 28.0%). In conclusion, policosanol was well tolerated in elderly patients taking beta-block- ers and did not increase AE. Additional reduction of blood pressure and a lower frequency of SAE were observed in policosanol patients compared with those taking placebo. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of policosanol was that expected.

17163386,"Prevention and treatment of influenza in high-risk groups: children, pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts, and nursing home residents.",kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"The pediatric population experiences preventable hospitalizations and serves as a reservoir for influenza and its transmission to other children as well as adults. As a consequence, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended initiating influenza immunization of children as young as 6 months of age through 23 months of age and, recently, up to 5 years of age. However, immunization of older children has not yet become a priority of the US Public Health Service. As a consequence, the importance of antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, cannot be overemphasized. From an epidemiological perspective, influenza resulted in higher childhood mortality than did Bordetella pertussis infection in 2003-2004. During that season, 153 children died of influenza, and two-thirds were <5 years of age. Importantly, nearly 50% of these children were previously healthy, with no underlying illness. Currently, 2 NA inhibitors are approved for the treatment of influenza in children. Zanamivir is approved for children >7 years of age, and oseltamivir is approved for children >1 year of age. Arguably, the younger children are at particular risk for influenza complications and hospitalization. In placebo-controlled studies in children >1 year of age, oseltamivir therapy accelerated resolution of clinical illness and defervescence and decreased both the incidence of otitis media and the concomitant use of antibiotics. However, oseltamivir is not currently approved for children <1 year of age. Three clinical toxicology studies identified neurotoxicity in newborn rats administered this medication. In these preclinical toxicology studies, the dose of oseltamivir exceeded that which would be used in humans. In addition, the metabolism of oseltamivir is different in rats than in humans. A key component of influenza therapy is the possibility for development of resistance. Although in studies performed in North America, resistance was not a frequent event, it has been documented in Japanese children treated with this medication; the adequacy of the dose used has been questioned. Children represent only one unique study population among others. Individuals who are at increased risk for influenza infection include the elderly, the immunocompromised, and pregnant women.

28817828,Fall-Prone Older People's Attitudes towards the Use of Virtual Reality Technology for Fall Prevention.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) technology is a relatively new rehabilitation tool that can deliver a combination of cognitive and motor training for fall prevention. The attitudes of older people to such training are currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate: (1) the attitudes of fall-prone older people towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR; (2) attitudinal changes after intervention with and without VR; and (3) user satisfaction following fall prevention exercise with and without VR. METHODS: A total of 281 fall-prone older people were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving treadmill training augmented by VR (TT+VR, n = 144) or a control group receiving treadmill training alone (TT, n = 137). Two questionnaires were used to measure (1) attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR (AQ); and (2) user satisfaction (USQ). AQ was evaluated at baseline and after intervention. USQ was measured after intervention only. RESULTS: The AQ revealed that most participants had positive attitudes towards fall prevention exercise at baseline (82.2%) and after intervention (80.6%; p = 0.144). In contrast, only 53.6% were enthusiastic about fall prevention exercise with VR at baseline. These attitudes positively changed after intervention (83.1%; p < 0.001), and 99.2% indicated that they enjoyed TT+VR. Correlation analyses showed that postintervention attitudes were strongly related to user satisfaction (USQ: r = 0.503; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older people's attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with VR were positively influenced by their experience. From the perspective of the user, VR is an attractive training mode, and thus improving service provision for older people is important. © 2017 S.

21414339,Differential impact of partial cortical blindness on gaze strategies when sitting and walking - an immersive virtual reality study.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"The present experiments aimed to characterize the visual performance of subjects with long-standing, unilateral cortical blindness when walking in a naturalistic, virtual environment. Under static, seated testing conditions, cortically blind subjects are known to exhibit compensatory eye movement strategies. However, they still complain of significant impairment in visual detection during navigation. To assess whether this is due to a change in compensatory eye movement strategy between sitting and walking, we measured eye and head movements in subjects asked to detect peripherally-presented, moving basketballs. When seated, cortically blind subjects detected ∼80% of balls, while controls detected almost all balls. Seated blind subjects did not make larger head movements than controls, but they consistently biased their fixation distribution towards their blind hemifield. When walking, head movements were similar in the two groups, but the fixation bias decreased to the point that fixation distribution in cortically blind subjects became similar to that in controls - with one major exception: at the time of basketball appearance, walking controls looked primarily at the far ground, in upper quadrants of the virtual field of view; cortically blind subjects looked significantly more at the near ground, in lower quadrants of the virtual field. Cortically blind subjects detected only 58% of the balls when walking while controls detected ∼90%. Thus, the adaptive gaze strategies adopted by cortically blind individuals as a compensation for their visual loss are strongest and most effective when seated and stationary. Walking significantly alters these gaze strategies in a way that seems to favor walking performance, but impairs peripheral target detection. It is possible that this impairment underlies the experienced difficulty of those with cortical blindness when navigating in real life. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

24763929,Virtual reality exercise improves mobility after stroke: an inpatient randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise using virtual reality (VR) has improved balance in adults with traumatic brain injury and community-dwelling older adults. Rigorous randomized studies regarding its efficacy, safety, and applicability with individuals after stroke are lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an adjunct VR therapy improves balance, mobility, and gait in stroke rehabilitation inpatients. METHODS: A blinded randomized controlled trial studying 59 stroke survivors on an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit was performed. The treatment group (n=30) received standard stroke rehabilitation therapy plus a program of VR exercises that challenged balance (eg, soccer goaltending, snowboarding) performed while standing. The control group (n=29) received standard stroke rehabilitation therapy plus exposure to identical VR environments but whose games did not challenge balance (performed in sitting). VR training consisted of 10 to 12 thirty-minute daily sessions for a 3-week period. Objective outcome measures of balance and mobility were assessed before, immediately after, and 1 month after training. RESULTS: Confidence intervals and effect sizes favored the treatment group on the Timed Up and Go and the Two-Minute Walk Test, with both groups meeting minimal clinical important differences after training. More individuals in the treatment group than in the control group showed reduced impairment in the lower extremity as measured by the Chedoke McMaster Leg domain (P=0.04) immediately after training. CONCLUSIONS: This VR exercise intervention for inpatient stroke rehabilitation improved mobility-related outcomes. Future studies could include nonambulatory participants as well as the implementation strategies for the clinical use of VR. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/.

1013,Impact of Virtual Environments on Motivation and Engagement During Exergames,scopus,1,1.0,,"Video games and sport are an essential part in the life of millions of people. With recent advances of immersive virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR, the use of virtual environments (VE) for exergames is becoming more and more popular. An exergame combines a physical activity with video game elements by tracking body movements or reactions of user, attempting to engage users in a more enjoyable system. In this paper, we present the results of a subjective experiment carried out with the aim to compare different kinds of virtual environments with each other. A rowing ergometer, connected either to a virtual reality system using a head-mounted display (HMD) or to a CAVE environment, was used as an exergame device. While for rowing experts, fitness and performance improvements are of major interest, we wanted to focus on the motivation and engagement of non-professionals. By means of a series of questionnaires and a follow-up interview, the Quality of Experience of participants using the system was assessed. Measurements include concepts such as flow, presence, video quality and well-being. Results show significant advantages of the HMD as well as of the CAVE compared to a system without a VE for the overall quality, system feedback, and flow. While the CAVE and HMD system mainly differed in their autotelic experience, the HMD was favored by the majority of participants due to a superior feeling of presence.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,1469,238,1,False,6bc7b452-a2c2-abcf-ecf2-8a33772e8b77,1-1,1367,533,1570971556754,,"{""1013"":19,""21414339"":4,""24763929"":3}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T12:59:32.467Z""}]",,,3.0,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da31fa32f3cb8011f089bfd,0000749d26--5da31fa32f3cb8011f089bfd,9da5feee87897ecc7fe1b4fb0ebc4892,APPROVED,2019-10-13T12:59:15.279,2019-10-13T12:59:55.379,2019-10-13T12:59:55.379,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,4.921,,4.921,4,1,True,6,19
25721132,Sensor-Based Interactive Balance Training with Visual Joint Movement Feedback for Improving Postural Stability in Diabetics with Peripheral Neuropathy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) have deficits in sensory and motor skills leading to inadequate proprioceptive feedback, impaired postural balance and higher fall risk. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of sensor-based interactive balance training on postural stability and daily physical activity in older adults with diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-nine older adults with DPN were enrolled (age 63.7 ± 8.2 years, BMI 30.6 ± 6, 54% females) and randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received sensor-based interactive exercise training tailored for people with diabetes (twice a week for 4 weeks). The exercises focused on shifting weight and crossing virtual obstacles. Body-worn sensors were implemented to acquire kinematic data and provide real-time joint visual feedback during the training. Outcome measurements included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during a balance test while the eyes were open and closed at baseline and after the intervention. Daily physical activities were also measured during a 48-hour period at baseline and at follow-up. Analysis of covariance was performed for the post-training outcome comparison. RESULTS: Compared with the CG, the patients in the IG showed a significantly reduced CoM sway (58.31%; p = 0.009), ankle sway (62.7%; p = 0.008) and hip joint sway (72.4%; p = 0.017) during the balance test with open eyes. The ankle sway was also significantly reduced in the IG group (58.8%; p = 0.037) during measurements while the eyes were closed. The number of steps walked showed a substantial but nonsignificant increase (+27.68%; p = 0.064) in the IG following training. CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that people with DPN can significantly improve their postural balance with diabetes-specific, tailored, sensor-based exercise training. The results promote the use of wearable technology in exercise training; however, future studies comparing this technology with commercially available systems are required to evaluate the benefit of interactive visual joint movement feedback. © 2015 S.

1032,Determining Physiological and Psychological Predictors of Time to Task Failure on a Virtual Reality Sørensen Test in Participants With and Without Recurrent Low Back Pain: Exploratory Study.,scopus,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Sørensen trunk extension endurance test performance predicts the development of low back pain and is a strong discriminator of those with and without low back pain. Performance may greatly depend on psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, and motivation. Virtual reality video games have been used in people with low back pain to encourage physical activity that would otherwise be avoided out of fear of pain or harm. Accordingly, we developed a virtual reality video game to assess the influence of immersive gaming on the Sørensen test performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine the physiological and psychological predictors of time to task failure (TTF) on a virtual reality Sørensen test in participants with and without a history of recurrent low back pain. METHODS: We recruited 24 individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain and 24 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched individuals without a history of low back pain. Participants completed a series of psychological measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pain Resilience Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and a self-efficacy measure. The maximal isometric strength of trunk and hip extensors and TTF on a virtual reality Sørensen test were measured. Electromyography of the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris was recorded during the strength and endurance trials. RESULTS: A two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in TTF between groups (P=.99), but there was a trend for longer TTF in females on the virtual reality Sørensen test (P=.06). Linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of TTF in each group. In healthy participants, the normalized median power frequency slope of erector spinae (beta=.450, P=.01), biceps femoris (beta=.400, P=.01), and trunk mass (beta=-.32, P=.02) predicted TTF. In participants with recurrent low back pain, trunk mass (beta=-.67, P<.001), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (beta=-.43, P=.01), and self-efficacy (beta=.35, P=.03) predicted TTF. CONCLUSIONS: Trunk mass appears to be a consistent predictor of performance. Kinesiophobia appears to negatively influence TTF for those with a history of recurrent low back pain, but does not influence healthy individuals. Self-efficacy is associated with better performance in individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain, whereas a less steep median power frequency slope of the trunk and hip extensors is associated with better performance in individuals without a history of low back pain.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2642,382,1,True,6bc7b452-a2c2-abcf-ecf2-8a33772e8b77,1-1,1367,533,1570971597072,,"{""1032"":1,""22640573"":3,""25721132"":18}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:00:31.779Z""}]",,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da31fcc1de93a011bbf3932,0000749d26--5da31fcc1de93a011bbf3932,9da5feee87897ecc7fe1b4fb0ebc4892,APPROVED,2019-10-13T12:59:56.195,2019-10-13T13:00:37.307,2019-10-13T13:00:37.307,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,5.497,,5.497,5,1,True,6,1

24885076,Retraining and assessing hand movement after stroke using the MusicGlove: comparison with conventional hand therapy and isometric grip training.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: It is thought that therapy should be functional, be highly repetitive, and promote afferent input to best stimulate hand motor recovery after stroke, yet patients struggle to access such therapy. We developed the MusicGlove, an instrumented glove that requires the user to practice gripping-like movements and thumb-finger opposition to play a highly engaging, music-based, video game. The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the effect of training with MusicGlove to conventional hand therapy 2) determine if MusicGlove training was more effective than a matched form of isometric hand movement training; and 3) determine if MusicGlove game scores predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: 12 chronic stroke survivors with moderate hemiparesis were randomly assigned to receive MusicGlove, isometric, and conventional hand therapy in a within-subjects design. Each subject participated in six one-hour treatment sessions three times per week for two weeks, for each training type, for a total of 18 treatment sessions. A blinded rater assessed hand impairment before and after each training type and at one-month follow-up including the Box and Blocks (B & B) test as the primary outcome measure. Subjects also completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). RESULTS: Subjects improved hand function related to grasping small objects more after MusicGlove compared to conventional training, as measured by the B & B score (improvement of 3.21±3.82 vs. -0.29±2.27 blocks; P=0.010) and the 9 Hole Peg test (improvement of 2.14±2.98 vs. -0.85±1.29 pegs/minute; P=0.005). There was no significant difference between training types in the broader assessment batteries of hand function. Subjects benefited less from isometric therapy than MusicGlove training, but the difference was not significant (P>0.09). Subjects sustained improvements in hand function at a one month follow-up, and found the MusicGlove more motivating than the other two therapies, as measured by the IMI.

25805886,"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neurocognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.",molina-2014,0,1.0,,"Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; treatment as usual; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment. Participants completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2 peak ml/kg/min), neurocognition (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), and serum-BDNF before and after and 12-week period. Twenty-six participants (79%) completed the study. At follow-up, the AE participants improved their AF by 18.0% vs a -0.5% decline in the TAU group (P = .002) and improved their neurocognition by 15.1% vs -2.0% decline in the TAU group (P = .031). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that enhancement in AF and increases in BDNF predicted 25.4% and 14.6% of the neurocognitive improvement variance, respectively. The results indicate AE is effective in enhancing neurocognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia and provide preliminary support for the impact of AE-related BDNF up-regulation on neurocognition in this population. Poor AF represents a modifiable risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia for which AE training offer a safe, nonstigmatizing, and side-effect-free intervention.  © The Author 2015.

25212521,Patients' use of a home-based virtual reality system to provide rehabilitation of the upper limb following stroke.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: A low-cost virtual reality system that translates movements of the hand, fingers, and thumb into game play was designed to provide a flexible and motivating approach to increasing adherence to home-based rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness depends on adherence, so did patients use the intervention to the recommended level? If not, what reasons did they give? The purpose of this study was to investigate these and related questions. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, plus qualitative analysis of interviews, was conducted. METHODS: Seventeen patients recovering from stroke recruited to the intervention arm of a feasibility trial had the equipment left in their homes for 8 weeks and were advised to use it 3 times a day for periods of no more than 20 minutes. Frequency and duration of use were automatically recorded. At the end of the intervention, participants were interviewed to determine barriers to using it in the recommended way. RESULTS: Duration of use and how many days they used the equipment are presented for the 13 participants who successfully started the intervention. These figures were highly variable and could fall far short of our recommendations. There was a weak positive correlation between duration and baseline reported activities of daily living. Participants reported lack of familiarity with technology and competing commitments as barriers to use, although they appreciated the flexibility of the intervention and found it motivating. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Level of use is variable and can fall far short of recommendations. Competing commitments were a barrier to use of the equipment, but participants reported that the intervention was flexible and motivating. It will not suit everyone, but some participants recorded high levels of use.

30782127,The (cost-) effectiveness of exergaming in people living with dementia and their informal caregivers: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is linked to benefits such as increased physical fitness, cognition, emotional and social functioning, general health and well-being in older people. Some evidence suggests that this also applies to people living with dementia. However, it can be harder for them to perform physical activities, due to several barriers, such as issues with orientation and balance problems. A relatively new type of physical activity called exergaming may help them overcome these barriers. Exergaming is physical exercise interactively combined with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exergaming compared to regular activities in people living with dementia, who attend day-care centres. Additionally, we want to investigate whether the exergaming activity for the person living with dementia, also (indirectly) affects the informal caregiver, as well as which facilitators and barriers to implementation of exergames for this target group exist. METHODS: A cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), with economic and process evaluations alongside will be carried out. In the Netherlands, 24 day-care centres are randomized in the experimental or control group. The study group will consist of 224 dyads (community-dwelling participants with dementia and their informal caregivers), who are interviewed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The participant with dementia has to visit the day-care centre for at least two days per week, have a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia and have an informal caregiver present, who is willing to participate. Societal cost data will be collected during interviews, using healthcare utilization diaries, and from day-care centres. The process evaluation will only involve the experimental group, and will include an online survey, qualitative interviews and focus groups. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to the evidence base that more effective exercise among people with dementia will result in positive effects on their wellbeing and quality of life. This will motivate people with dementia to be physically active. We also envision that there might be a positive effect on the burden of care experienced by their informal caregivers.

23841967,Neural reorganization accompanying upper limb motor rehabilitation from stroke with virtual reality-based gesture therapy.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Gesture Therapy is an upper limb virtual reality rehabilitation-based therapy for stroke survivors. It promotes motor rehabilitation by challenging patients with simple computer games representative of daily activities for self-support. This therapy has demonstrated clinical value, but the underlying functional neural reorganization changes associated with this therapy that are responsible for the behavioral improvements are not yet known. OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantify the occurrence of neural reorganization strategies that underlie motor improvements as they occur during the practice of Gesture Therapy and to identify those strategies linked to a better prognosis. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroscans were longitudinally collected at 4 time points during Gesture Therapy administration to 8 patients. Behavioral improvements were monitored using the Fugl-Meyer scale and Motricity Index. Activation loci were anatomically labelled and translated to reorganization strategies. Strategies are quantified by counting the number of active clusters in brain regions tied to them. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated significant behavioral improvements (P < .05). Contralesional activation of the unaffected motor cortex, cerebellar recruitment, and compensatory prefrontal cortex activation were the most prominent strategies evoked. A strong and significant correlation between motor dexterity upon commencing therapy and total recruited activity was found (r2 = 0.80; P < .05), and overall brain activity during therapy was inversely related to normalized behavioral improvements (r2 = 0.64; P < .05).

24589630,Association of a television in the bedroom with increased adiposity gain in a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity affects health in children and adolescents. Television viewing is an established risk factor for obesity in youth. No prospective study has assessed whether a bedroom television confers an additional risk for obesity in youth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective association between the presence of a bedroom television and change in body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), independent of television viewing, in a nationally representative sample of US children and adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a random-digit prospective telephone survey that captured children and adolescents from across the United States. Participants included 6522 boys and girls aged 10 to 14 years at baseline who were surveyed via telephone about media risk factors for obesity.Weighted regressions assessed adiposity at 2- and 4-year follow-up, controlling for television and movie viewing, video-game playing, parenting, age, sex, race or ethnicity, household income, and parental educational level. EXPOSURE: Report of having a television in the bedroom at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age- and sex-adjusted BMI based on self-report and parent report of weight and height at 2- and 4-year follow-up. RESULTS: Distributions for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were similar to census estimates for the US population. Sample weighting methods accounted for higher dropout rates among ethnic minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Bedroom televisions were reported by 59.1%of participants at baseline, with boys, ethnic minorities, and those of lower socioeconomic status having significantly higher rates. In multivariate analyses, having a bedroom television was associated with an excess BMI of 0.57 (95%CI, 0.31-0.82) and 0.75 (0.38-1.12) at years 2 and 4, respectively, and a BMI gain of 0.24 (0.02-0.45) from years 2 to 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Having a bedroom television is associated with weight gain beyond the effect of television viewing time. This association could be the result of uncaptured effects of television viewing or of disrupted sleep patterns. With the high prevalence of bedroom televisions, the effect attributable to this risk factor among US children and adolescents is excess weight of 8.7 million kg/y.",,long,short,0,0,0-0,2364,406,1,True,c16c3294-d382-c64a-b620-c047a5339192,0-0,1920,857,1570971767710,,"{""23841967"":13,""24589630"":24,""30782127"":25}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:03:13.330Z""}]",,,1.0,,0-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da32076942cf6010ef4e7f0,0000749d26--5da32076942cf6010ef4e7f0,c229e466c26ff44669ae73d912261d9b,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:02:46.374,2019-10-13T13:03:50.980,2019-10-13T13:03:50.980,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,25.62,,25.62,1,0,True,2,24

DESIGN: Assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two acute care university teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with UVL (N=71) who had dizziness/vertigo, and gait and balance impairment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with UVL were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of either conventional (n=36) or virtual reality-based (n=35) balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation. The virtual reality-based group received an off-the-shelf virtual reality gaming system for home exercise, and the conventional group received a foam balance mat. Treatment comprised weekly visits to a physiotherapist and a daily home exercise program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-preferred gait speed. Secondary outcomes included other gait parameters and tasks, Sensory Organization Test (SOT), dynamic visual acuity, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefits Questionnaire, and Activities Balance Confidence Questionnaire. The subjective experience of vestibular rehabilitation was measured with a questionnaire. RESULTS: Both groups improved, but there were no significant differences in gait speed between the groups postintervention (mean difference, -.03m/s; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.09 to .02m/s). There were also no significant differences between the groups in SOT scores (mean difference, .82%; 95% CI, -5.00% to 6.63%) or on any of the other secondary outcomes (P>.05). In both groups, adherence to exercise was high (∼77%), but the virtual reality-based group reported significantly more enjoyment (P=.001), less difficulty with (P=.009) and less tiredness after (P=.03) balance exercises. At 6 months, there were no significant between-group differences in physical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality-based balance exercises performed during vestibular rehabilitation were not superior to conventional balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation but may provide a more enjoyable method of retraining balance after unilateral peripheral vestibular loss.

23388087,V-TIME: a treadmill training program augmented by virtual reality to decrease fall risk in older adults: study design of a randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Recent work has demonstrated that fall risk can be attributed to cognitive as well as motor deficits. Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk. METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred older adults with a history of falls will be recruited to participate in this study. This will include older adults (n=100), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n=100), and patients with Parkinson's disease (n=100). These three sub-groups will be recruited in order to evaluate the effects of the intervention in people with a range of motor and cognitive deficits. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (treadmill training with virtual reality) or to the active-control group (treadmill training without virtual reality). Each person will participate in a training program set in an outpatient setting 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Assessments will take place before, after, and 1 month and 6 months after the completion of the training. A falls calendar will be kept by each participant for 6 months after completing the training to assess fall incidence (i.e., the number of falls, multiple falls and falls rate).

21799138,Effects of an interactive computer game exercise regimen on balance impairment in frail community-dwelling older adults: a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Due to the many problems associated with reduced balance and mobility, providing an effective and engaging rehabilitation regimen is essential to progress recovery from impairments and to help prevent further degradation of motor skills. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and benefits of physical therapy based on a task-oriented approach delivered via an engaging, interactive video game paradigm. The intervention focused on performing targeted dynamic tasks, which included reactive balance controls and environmental interaction. DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in a geriatric day hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty community-dwelling and ambulatory older adults attending the day hospital for treatment of balance and mobility limitations participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS: Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed Up & Go Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures. CONCLUSION: Dynamic balance exercises on fixed and compliant sponge surfaces were feasibly coupled to interactive game-based exercise. This coupling, in turn, resulted in a greater improvement in dynamic standing balance control compared with the typical exercise program.

23388087,V-TIME: a treadmill training program augmented by virtual reality to decrease fall risk in older adults: study design of a randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Recent work has demonstrated that fall risk can be attributed to cognitive as well as motor deficits. Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk. METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred older adults with a history of falls will be recruited to participate in this study. This will include older adults (n=100), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n=100), and patients with Parkinson's disease (n=100). These three sub-groups will be recruited in order to evaluate the effects of the intervention in people with a range of motor and cognitive deficits. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (treadmill training with virtual reality) or to the active-control group (treadmill training without virtual reality). Each person will participate in a training program set in an outpatient setting 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Assessments will take place before, after, and 1 month and 6 months after the completion of the training. A falls calendar will be kept by each participant for 6 months after completing the training to assess fall incidence (i.e., the number of falls, multiple falls and falls rate). In addition, we will measure gait under usual and dual task conditions, balance, community mobility, health related quality of life, user satisfaction and cognitive function. DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial will demonstrate the extent to which an intervention that combines treadmill training augmented by virtual reality reduces fall risk, improves mobility and enhances cognitive function in a diverse group of older adults.

25842051,Effectiveness of conventional versus virtual reality-based balance exercises in vestibular rehabilitation for unilateral peripheral vestibular loss: results of a randomized controlled trial.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of virtual reality-based balance exercises to conventional balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular loss (UVL). DESIGN: Assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two acute care university teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with UVL (N=71) who had dizziness/vertigo, and gait and balance impairment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with UVL were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of either conventional (n=36) or virtual reality-based (n=35) balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation. The virtual reality-based group received an off-the-shelf virtual reality gaming system for home exercise, and the conventional group received a foam balance mat. Treatment comprised weekly visits to a physiotherapist and a daily home exercise program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-preferred gait speed. Secondary outcomes included other gait parameters and tasks, Sensory Organization Test (SOT), dynamic visual acuity, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefits Questionnaire, and Activities Balance Confidence Questionnaire. The subjective experience of vestibular rehabilitation was measured with a questionnaire. RESULTS: Both groups improved, but there were no significant differences in gait speed between the groups postintervention (mean difference, -.03m/s; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.09 to .02m/s). There were also no significant differences between the groups in SOT scores (mean difference, .82%; 95% CI, -5.00% to 6.63%) or on any of the other secondary outcomes (P>.05). In both groups, adherence to exercise was high (∼77%), but the virtual reality-based group reported significantly more enjoyment (P=.001), less difficulty with (P=.009) and less tiredness after (P=.03) balance exercises. At 6 months, there were no significant between-group differences in physical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality-based balance exercises performed during vestibular rehabilitation were not superior to conventional balance exercises during vestibular rehabilitation but may provide a more enjoyable method of retraining balance after unilateral peripheral vestibular loss.

1046,Influence of UI Complexity and Positioning on User Experience During VR Exergames,scholar,1,1.0,,"In past years, as virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast developing fields in VR are exergames, a combination of physical exercise and game. With a goal to engage people in physical activity, VR exergames should look and feel good for users. Therefore, user interface (UI) in VR is important and has to be built in a way to enhance user experience. In this paper, ergometer is used together with VR rowing environment as VR exergame for a study aiming to explore possibilities of UI in VR. Accordingly, different metrics commonly used to quantify rowing action (e.g, speed and distance) were visualized. The visualizations that were created had different positioning (closer or further away from the player) and different level of complexity (more or less metrics shown as only numbers or in a gamified design). Participants (N = 27) during experiment for this study rowed four times in different conditions depending were metrics of the game were shown: 1) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with gamified visualization of metrics; 2) as a coach boat that follows the player with gamified visualization of metrics on a screen; 3) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with digital visualization of metrics; 4) as a coach boat that follows the player with digital visualization of metrics on a screen. Results show that level of UI complexity has a significant influence on readability, while positioning of UI elements significantly influences users' perception of support from system.

28817828,Fall-Prone Older People's Attitudes towards the Use of Virtual Reality Technology for Fall Prevention.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) technology is a relatively new rehabilitation tool that can deliver a combination of cognitive and motor training for fall prevention. The attitudes of older people to such training are currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate: (1) the attitudes of fall-prone older people towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR; (2) attitudinal changes after intervention with and without VR; and (3) user satisfaction following fall prevention exercise with and without VR. METHODS: A total of 281 fall-prone older people were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving treadmill training augmented by VR (TT+VR, n = 144) or a control group receiving treadmill training alone (TT, n = 137). Two questionnaires were used to measure (1) attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR (AQ); and (2) user satisfaction (USQ). AQ was evaluated at baseline and after intervention. USQ was measured after intervention only. RESULTS: The AQ revealed that most participants had positive attitudes towards fall prevention exercise at baseline (82.2%) and after intervention (80.6%; p = 0.144). In contrast, only 53.6% were enthusiastic about fall prevention exercise with VR at baseline. These attitudes positively changed after intervention (83.1%; p < 0.001), and 99.2% indicated that they enjoyed TT+VR. Correlation analyses showed that postintervention attitudes were strongly related to user satisfaction (USQ: r = 0.503; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older people's attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with VR were positively influenced by their experience. From the perspective of the user, VR is an attractive training mode, and thus improving service provision for older people is important. © 2017 S.

17584501,Aging and selective sensorimotor strategies in the regulation of upright balance.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: The maintenance of upright equilibrium is essentially a sensorimotor integration task. The central nervous system (CNS) has to generate appropriate and complex motor responses based on the selective and rapid integration of sensory information from multiple sources. Since each sensory system has its own coordinate framework, specific time delay and reliability, sensory conflicts may arise and represent situations in which the CNS has to recalibrate the weight attributed to each particular sensory input. The resolution of sensory conflicts may represent a particular challenge for older adults given the age-related decline in the integrity of many postural regulating systems, including musculoskeletal and sensory systems, as well as neural processing and conduction of information. The effects of aging and adaptation (by repeated exposures) on the capability of the CNS to select pertinent sensory information and resolve sensory conflicts were thus investigated with virtual reality (VR) in the present study. METHODS: Healthy young and older adults maintained quiet stance while immersed in a virtual environment (VE) for 1 hour during which transient visual and/or surface perturbations were randomly presented. Visual perturbations were induced by sudden pitch or roll plane tilts of the VE viewed through a helmet-mounted display, and combined with or without surface perturbations presented in a direction that was either identical or opposite to the visual perturbations. RESULTS: Results showed a profound influence of aging on postural adjustments measured by electromyographic (EMG) responses and displacements of the center of pressure (COP) and body's center of mass (COM) in the recovery of upright stance, especially in the presence of sensory conflicts. Older adults relied more on vision as compared to young adults. Aging affects the interaction of the somatosensory and visual systems on the control of equilibrium during standing and the ability of CNS to resolve sensory conflicts. However, even with a one-hour immersion in VE and exposure to sensory conflicts, it is possible for the CNS to recalibrate and adapt to the changes, while improving balance capability in older adults. CONCLUSION: Preventive and rehabilitation programs targeting postural control in older adults should take into account the possible impairment of sensory organization or sensorimotor integration and include VE training under conditions of sensory conflicts.",,long,long,0,0,0-1,2481,403,1,True,55ff25dd-286f-2c74-9cdf-1affd9745d86,x-x,1366,577,1570971912422,,"{""17163386"":20,""17584501"":18,""28817828"":18}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:05:53.664Z""}]",,,5.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da32105e5ae53011e0e7d15,0000749d26--5da32105e5ae53011e0e7d15,3885f6178295c7764bcfaa231fb2b023,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:05:09.278,2019-10-13T13:06:15.411,2019-10-13T13:06:15.411,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,18.495,,18.495,2,0,False,2,18

METHODS: Thirty-two CP patients (10.7��3.2 years old) were randomly assigned to either Wii-therapy (SDI=7; SHE=9) or SPT intervention (SDI=7; SHE=9). In each group, patients received three sessions per week over a period of 6 weeks. Standing balance was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks. Additionally, two follow-up assessments (4 additional weeks) were performed to determine post-treatment effectiveness. Standing balance was quantified on force platform obtaining the outcomes area of center-of-pressure (CoP) sway (CoPSway), standard deviation in the medial-lateral (SDML) and the anterior-posterior (SDAP) directions, and velocity in both directions (VML and VAP). RESULTS: Compared to SPT, Wii-therapy significantly reduced the CoPSway (P=0.02) and SDAP in the eyes-open condition (P=0.01). However, the effects wane after 2-4 weeks. Post-hoc analysis revealed that only SHE children benefited from Wii-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Wii-therapy was better than SPT in improving standing balance in patients with CP, but improves the balance only in SHE patients. Also, Wii-therapy effectiveness waned 2-4 weeks after the end the intervention. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: A systematic exercise program like Wii-therapy using the Nintendo Wii Balance Board device can be considered to improves the standing balance in patients with CP, specifically in the SHE type. This program is easy to transfer to physiotherapists and rehabilitation centers.",,long,short,0,1,1-0,2422,427,1,True,48238df9-9749-9fa9-e10f-7a95dc9c5a6b,1-0,1280,498,1570971928145,,"{""17163386"":1,""27882910"":8,""28817828"":9}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:06:11.772Z""}]",,,15.0,,1-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da321173c4a5c011d847db7,0000749d26--5da321173c4a5c011d847db7,5b4f252ef58ee86133d4559a65c49602,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:05:27.240,2019-10-13T13:06:47.002,2019-10-13T13:06:47.002,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,31.334,,31.334,1,0,True,3,8
28817828,Fall-Prone Older People's Attitudes towards the Use of Virtual Reality Technology for Fall Prevention.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) technology is a relatively new rehabilitation tool that can deliver a combination of cognitive and motor training for fall prevention. The attitudes of older people to such training are currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate: (1) the attitudes of fall-prone older people towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR; (2) attitudinal changes after intervention with and without VR; and (3) user satisfaction following fall prevention exercise with and without VR. METHODS: A total of 281 fall-prone older people were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving treadmill training augmented by VR (TT+VR, n = 144) or a control group receiving treadmill training alone (TT, n = 137). Two questionnaires were used to measure (1) attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR (AQ); and (2) user satisfaction (USQ). AQ was evaluated at baseline and after intervention. USQ was measured after intervention only. RESULTS: The AQ revealed that most participants had positive attitudes towards fall prevention exercise at baseline (82.2%) and after intervention (80.6%; p = 0.144). In contrast, only 53.6% were enthusiastic about fall prevention exercise with VR at baseline. These attitudes positively changed after intervention (83.1%; p < 0.001), and 99.2% indicated that they enjoyed TT+VR. Correlation analyses showed that postintervention attitudes were strongly related to user satisfaction (USQ: r = 0.503; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older people's attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with VR were positively influenced by their experience. From the perspective of the user, VR is an attractive training mode, and thus improving service provision for older people is important. © 2017 S.

22768793,"Reaching out, inviting back: using Interactive voice response (IVR) technology to recycle relapsed smokers back to Quitline treatment--a randomized controlled trial.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco dependence is a chronic, relapsing condition that typically requires multiple quit attempts and extended treatment. When offered the opportunity, relapsed smokers are interested in recycling back into treatment for a new, assisted quit attempt. This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of interactive voice response (IVR) in recycling low income smokers who had previously used quitline (QL) support back to QL support for a new quit attempt. METHODS: A sample of 2985 previous QL callers were randomized to either receive IVR screening for current smoking (control group) or IVR screening plus an IVR intervention. The IVR intervention consists of automated questions to identify and address barriers to re-cycling in QL support, followed by an offer to be transferred to the QL and reinitiate treatment. Re-enrollment in QL services for both groups was documented. RESULTS: The IVR system successfully reached 715 (23.9%) former QL participants. Of those, 27% (194/715) reported to the IVR system that they had quit smoking and were therefore excluded from the study and analysis. The trial's final sample was composed of 521 current smokers. The re-enrollment rate was 3.3% for the control group and 28.2% for the intervention group (p < .001). Logistic regression results indicated an 11.2 times higher odds for re-enrollment of the intervention group than the control group (p < .001). Results did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, or level of education, however recycled smokers were older (Mean = 45.2; SD = 11.7) than smokers who declined a new treatment cycle (Mean = 41.8; SD = 13.2); (p = 0.013). The main barriers reported for not engaging in a new treatment cycle were low self-efficacy and lack of interest in quitting. After delivering IVR messages targeting these reported barriers, 32% of the smokers reporting low self-efficacy and 4.8% of those reporting lack of interest in quitting re-engaged in a new QL treatment cycle. CONCLUSION: Proactive IVR outreach is a promising tool to engage low income, relapsed smokers back into a new cycle of treatment. Integration of IVR intervention for recycling smokers with previous QL treatment has the potential to decrease tobacco-related disparities.

To assess whether this is due to a change in compensatory eye movement strategy between sitting and walking, we measured eye and head movements in subjects asked to detect peripherally-presented, moving basketballs.

Cortically blind subjects detected only 58% of the balls when walking while controls detected ∼90%. Thus, the adaptive gaze strategies adopted by cortically blind individuals as a compensation for their visual loss are strongest and most effective when seated and stationary.

24763929,Virtual reality exercise improves mobility after stroke: an inpatient randomized controlled trial.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise using virtual reality (VR) has improved balance in adults with traumatic brain injury and community-dwelling older adults. Rigorous randomized studies regarding its efficacy, safety, and applicability with individuals after stroke are lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an adjunct VR therapy improves balance, mobility, and gait in stroke rehabilitation inpatients. METHODS: A blinded randomized controlled trial studying 59 stroke survivors on an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit was performed. The treatment group (n=30) received standard stroke rehabilitation therapy plus a program of VR exercises that challenged balance (eg, soccer goaltending, snowboarding) performed while standing. The control group (n=29) received standard stroke rehabilitation therapy plus exposure to identical VR environments but whose games did not challenge balance (performed in sitting). VR training consisted of 10 to 12 thirty-minute daily sessions for a 3-week period. Objective outcome measures of balance and mobility were assessed before, immediately after, and 1 month after training. RESULTS: Confidence intervals and effect sizes favored the treatment group on the Timed Up and Go and the Two-Minute Walk Test, with both groups meeting minimal clinical important differences after training. More individuals in the treatment group than in the control group showed reduced impairment in the lower extremity as measured by the Chedoke McMaster Leg domain (P=0.04) immediately after training.

METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke.

29149855,Increasing upper limb training intensity in chronic stroke using embodied virtual reality: a pilot study.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. METHODS: Ten outpatient stroke survivors with chronic (>6��months) upper extremity paresis participated in a ten-session VR-based upper limb rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week). RESULTS: All participants completed all sessions of the treatment. In total, they received a median of 403��min of upper limb therapy, with 290��min of effective training. Within that time, participants performed a median of 4713 goal-directed movements. Importantly, training intensity increased progressively across sessions from 13.2 to 17.3 movements per minute. Clinical measures show that despite being in the chronic phase, where recovery potential is thought to be limited, participants showed a median improvement rate of 5.3% in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity; FMA-UE) post intervention compared to baseline, and of 15.4% at one-month follow-up. For three of them, this improvement was clinically significant. A significant improvement in shoulder active range of motion (AROM) was also observed at follow-up. Participants reported very low levels of pain, stress and fatigue following each session of training, indicating that the intensive VR intervention was well tolerated. No severe adverse events were reported. All participants expressed their interest in continuing the intervention at the hospital or even at home, suggesting high levels of adherence and motivation for the provided intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed how a dedicated VR system could deliver high rehabilitation doses and, importantly, intensive training in chronic stroke survivors. FMA-UE and AROM results suggest that task-specific VR training may be beneficial for further functional recovery both in the chronic stage of stroke. Longitudinal studies with higher doses and sample sizes are required to confirm the therapy effectiveness.

1032,Determining Physiological and Psychological Predictors of Time to Task Failure on a Virtual Reality Sørensen Test in Participants With and Without Recurrent Low Back Pain: Exploratory Study.,scopus,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Sørensen trunk extension endurance test performance predicts the development of low back pain and is a strong discriminator of those with and without low back pain. Performance may greatly depend on psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, and motivation. Virtual reality video games have been used in people with low back pain to encourage physical activity that would otherwise be avoided out of fear of pain or harm. Accordingly, we developed a virtual reality video game to assess the influence of immersive gaming on the Sørensen test performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine the physiological and psychological predictors of time to task failure (TTF) on a virtual reality Sørensen test in participants with and without a history of recurrent low back pain. METHODS: We recruited 24 individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain and 24 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched individuals without a history of low back pain. Participants completed a series of psychological measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pain Resilience Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and a self-efficacy measure. The maximal isometric strength of trunk and hip extensors and TTF on a virtual reality Sørensen test were measured. Electromyography of the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris was recorded during the strength and endurance trials. RESULTS: A two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in TTF between groups (P=.99), but there was a trend for longer TTF in females on the virtual reality Sørensen test (P=.06). Linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of TTF in each group. In healthy participants, the normalized median power frequency slope of erector spinae (beta=.450, P=.01), biceps femoris (beta=.400, P=.01), and trunk mass (beta=-.32, P=.02) predicted TTF. In participants with recurrent low back pain, trunk mass (beta=-.67, P<.001), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (beta=-.43, P=.01), and self-efficacy (beta=.35, P=.03) predicted TTF. CONCLUSIONS: Trunk mass appears to be a consistent predictor of performance. Kinesiophobia appears to negatively influence TTF for those with a history of recurrent low back pain, but does not influence healthy individuals. Self-efficacy is associated with better performance in individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain, whereas a less steep median power frequency slope of the trunk and hip extensors is associated with better performance in individuals without a history of low back pain.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2642,382,1,True,83e61014-18a8-52b7-9214-cbedc93e6227,x-x,412,628,1570972019648,,"{""1032"":24,""25721132"":158,""29149855"":70}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:10:31.510Z""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da321736b52da01226248af,0000749d26--5da321736b52da01226248af,8e1e917a27d1fc17285f66ce5dfeaf5e,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:06:59.598,2019-10-13T13:14:00.849,2019-10-13T13:14:00.849,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,112.594,,112.594,1,1,False,2,24

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of sensor-based interactive balance training on postural stability and daily physical activity in older adults with diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-nine older adults with DPN were enrolled (age 63.7 ± 8.2 years, BMI 30.6 ± 6, 54% females) and randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received sensor-based interactive exercise training tailored for people with diabetes (twice a week for 4 weeks). The exercises focused on shifting weight and crossing virtual obstacles. Body-worn sensors were implemented to acquire kinematic data and provide real-time joint visual feedback during the training. Outcome measurements included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during a balance test while the eyes were open and closed at baseline and after the intervention. Daily physical activities were also measured during a 48-hour period at baseline and at follow-up. Analysis of covariance was performed for the post-training outcome comparison. RESULTS: Compared with the CG, the patients in the IG showed a significantly reduced CoM sway (58.31%; p = 0.009), ankle sway (62.7%; p = 0.008) and hip joint sway (72.4%; p = 0.017) during the balance test with open eyes. The ankle sway was also significantly reduced in the IG group (58.8%; p = 0.037) during measurements while the eyes were closed. The number of steps walked showed a substantial but nonsignificant increase (+27.68%; p = 0.064) in the IG following training. CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that people with DPN can significantly improve their postural balance with diabetes-specific, tailored, sensor-based exercise training.

METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke.

1032,Determining Physiological and Psychological Predictors of Time to Task Failure on a Virtual Reality Sørensen Test in Participants With and Without Recurrent Low Back Pain: Exploratory Study.,scopus,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Sørensen trunk extension endurance test performance predicts the development of low back pain and is a strong discriminator of those with and without low back pain. Performance may greatly depend on psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, and motivation. Virtual reality video games have been used in people with low back pain to encourage physical activity that would otherwise be avoided out of fear of pain or harm. Accordingly, we developed a virtual reality video game to assess the influence of immersive gaming on the Sørensen test performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine the physiological and psychological predictors of time to task failure (TTF) on a virtual reality Sørensen test in participants with and without a history of recurrent low back pain. METHODS: We recruited 24 individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain and 24 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched individuals without a history of low back pain. Participants completed a series of psychological measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pain Resilience Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and a self-efficacy measure.

26181226,Upper limb rehabilitation after spinal cord injury: a treatment based on a data glove and an immersive virtual reality environment.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"Purpose state: The aim of this preliminary study was to test a data glove, CyberTouch™, combined with a virtual reality (VR) environment, for using in therapeutic training of reaching movements after spinal cord injury (SCI). METHOD: Nine patients with thoracic SCI were selected to perform a pilot study by comparing two treatments: patients in the intervention group (IG) conducted a VR training based on the use of a data glove, CyberTouch™ for 2 weeks, while patients in the control group (CG) only underwent the traditional rehabilitation. Furthermore, two functional parameters were implemented in order to assess patient's performance of the sessions: normalized trajectory lengths and repeatability. RESULTS: Although no statistical significance was found, the data glove group seemed to obtain clinical changes in the muscle balance (MB) and functional parameters, and in the dexterity, coordination and fine grip tests. Moreover, every patient showed variations in at least one of the functional parameters, either along Y-axis trajectory or Z-axis trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: This study might be a step forward for the investigation of new uses of motion capture systems in neurorehabilitation, making it possible to train activities of daily living (ADLs) in motivational environments while measuring objectively the patient's functional evolution. Implications for Rehabilitation Key findings: A motion capture application based on a data glove is presented, for being used as a virtual reality tool for rehabilitation. This application has provided objective data about patient's functional performance. What the study has added: (1) This study allows to open new areas of research based on the use of different motion capture systems as rehabilitation tools, making it possible to train Activities of Daily Living in motivational environments.

1008,3-D streaming supplying partner protocols for mobile collaborative exergaming for health,pubmed,1,1.0,,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data.

The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the effect of training with MusicGlove to conventional hand therapy 2) determine if MusicGlove training was more effective than a matched form of isometric hand movement training; and 3) determine if MusicGlove game scores predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: 12 chronic stroke survivors with moderate hemiparesis were randomly assigned to receive MusicGlove, isometric, and conventional hand therapy in a within-subjects design. Each subject participated in six one-hour treatment sessions three times per week for two weeks, for each training type, for a total of 18 treatment sessions. A blinded rater assessed hand impairment before and after each training type and at one-month follow-up including the Box and Blocks (B & B) test as the primary outcome measure.

28333997,Learning better by repetition or variation? Is transfer at odds with task specific training?,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: Transfer of motor skills is the ultimate goal of motor training in rehabilitation practice. In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. METHOD: One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6-10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. RESULTS: ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children. The type of practice adopted does not seem to influence children's ability to transfer skills acquired in an exergame to life situations but the number of identical elements does.",,long,medium,1,1,1-1,1590,292,1,True,2dd6c805-e3bd-7fb0-0171-5fc5c90c6794,1-1,1408,587,1570972336392,,"{""24885076"":28,""26181226"":19,""28333997"":28}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:13:26.253Z""}]",,,2.0,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da322ad4c8219010d9870df,0000749d26--5da322ad4c8219010d9870df,3b1f43ffcc977f875d9a96adbeade136,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:12:13.745,2019-10-13T13:13:46.005,2019-10-13T13:13:46.005,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,27.878,,27.878,4,1,True,6,28
26181226,Upper limb rehabilitation after spinal cord injury: a treatment based on a data glove and an immersive virtual reality environment.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"Purpose state: The aim of this preliminary study was to test a data glove, CyberTouch™, combined with a virtual reality (VR) environment, for using in therapeutic training of reaching movements after spinal cord injury (SCI). METHOD: Nine patients with thoracic SCI were selected to perform a pilot study by comparing two treatments: patients in the intervention group (IG) conducted a VR training based on the use of a data glove, CyberTouch™ for 2 weeks, while patients in the control group (CG) only underwent the traditional rehabilitation. Furthermore, two functional parameters were implemented in order to assess patient's performance of the sessions: normalized trajectory lengths and repeatability. RESULTS: Although no statistical significance was found, the data glove group seemed to obtain clinical changes in the muscle balance (MB) and functional parameters, and in the dexterity, coordination and fine grip tests. Moreover, every patient showed variations in at least one of the functional parameters, either along Y-axis trajectory or Z-axis trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: This study might be a step forward for the investigation of new uses of motion capture systems in neurorehabilitation, making it possible to train activities of daily living (ADLs) in motivational environments while measuring objectively the patient's functional evolution. Implications for Rehabilitation Key findings: A motion capture application based on a data glove is presented, for being used as a virtual reality tool for rehabilitation. This application has provided objective data about patient's functional performance. What the study has added: (1) This study allows to open new areas of research based on the use of different motion capture systems as rehabilitation tools, making it possible to train Activities of Daily Living in motivational environments.

When offered the opportunity, relapsed smokers are interested in recycling back into treatment for a new, assisted quit attempt. This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of interactive voice response (IVR) in recycling low income smokers who had previously used quitline (QL) support back to QL support for a new quit attempt. METHODS: A sample of 2985 previous QL callers were randomized to either receive IVR screening for current smoking (control group) or IVR screening plus an IVR intervention. The IVR intervention consists of automated questions to identify and address barriers to re-cycling in QL support, followed by an offer to be transferred to the QL and reinitiate treatment. Re-enrollment in QL services for both groups was documented. RESULTS: The IVR system successfully reached 715 (23.9%) former QL participants. Of those, 27% (194/715) reported to the IVR system that they had quit smoking and were therefore excluded from the study and analysis. The trial's final sample was composed of 521 current smokers. The re-enrollment rate was 3.3% for the control group and 28.2% for the intervention group (p < .001). Logistic regression results indicated an 11.2 times higher odds for re-enrollment of the intervention group than the control group (p < .001). Results did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, or level of education, however recycled smokers were older (Mean = 45.2; SD = 11.7) than smokers who declined a new treatment cycle (Mean = 41.8; SD = 13.2); (p = 0.013). The main barriers reported for not engaging in a new treatment cycle were low self-efficacy and lack of interest in quitting. After delivering IVR messages targeting these reported barriers, 32% of the smokers reporting low self-efficacy and 4.8% of those reporting lack of interest in quitting re-engaged in a new QL treatment cycle. CONCLUSION: Proactive IVR outreach is a promising tool to engage low income, relapsed smokers back into a new cycle of treatment. Integration of IVR intervention for recycling smokers with previous QL treatment has the potential to decrease tobacco-related disparities.

27378656,Restoring movement representation and alleviating phantom limb pain through short-term neurorehabilitation with a virtual reality system.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We developed a quantitative method to measure movement representations of a phantom upper limb using a bimanual circle-line coordination task (BCT). We investigated whether short-term neurorehabilitation with a virtual reality (VR) system would restore voluntary movement representations and alleviate phantom limb pain (PLP). METHODS: Eight PLP patients were enrolled. In the BCT, they repeatedly drew vertical lines using the intact hand and intended to draw circles using the phantom limb. Drawing circles mentally using the phantom limb led to the emergence of an oval transfiguration of the vertical lines ('bimanual-coupling' effect). We quantitatively measured the degree of this bimanual-coupling effect as movement representations of the phantom limb before and immediately after short-term VR neurorehabilitation. This was achieved using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for PLP intensity and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). During VR neurorehabilitation, patients wore a head-mounted display that showed a mirror-reversed computer graphic image of an intact arm (the virtual phantom limb). By intending to move both limbs simultaneously and similarly, the patients perceived voluntary execution of movement in their phantom limb. RESULTS: Short-term VR neurorehabilitation promptly restored voluntary movement representations in the BCT and alleviated PLP (NRS: p = 0.015; 39.1 ± 28.4% relief, SF-MPQ: p = 0.015; 61.5 ± 48.5% relief). Restoration of phantom limb movement representations and reduced PLP intensity were linearly correlated (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VR rehabilitation may encourage patient's motivation and multimodal sensorimotor re-integration of a phantom limb and subsequently have a potent analgesic effect.

OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness depends on adherence, so did patients use the intervention to the recommended level? If not, what reasons did they give? The purpose of this study was to investigate these and related questions. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, plus qualitative analysis of interviews, was conducted. METHODS: Seventeen patients recovering from stroke recruited to the intervention arm of a feasibility trial had the equipment left in their homes for 8 weeks and were advised to use it 3 times a day for periods of no more than 20 minutes. Frequency and duration of use were automatically recorded. At the end of the intervention, participants were interviewed to determine barriers to using it in the recommended way. RESULTS: Duration of use and how many days they used the equipment are presented for the 13 participants who successfully started the intervention. These figures were highly variable and could fall far short of our recommendations. There was a weak positive correlation between duration and baseline reported activities of daily living. Participants reported lack of familiarity with technology and competing commitments as barriers to use, although they appreciated the flexibility of the intervention and found it motivating. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Level of use is variable and can fall far short of recommendations.

21718542,Viewing medium affects arm motor performance in 3D virtual environments.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: 2D and 3D virtual reality platforms are used for designing individualized training environments for post-stroke rehabilitation. Virtual environments (VEs) are viewed using media like head mounted displays (HMDs) and large screen projection systems (SPS) which can influence the quality of perception of the environment. We estimated if there were differences in arm pointing kinematics when subjects with and without stroke viewed a 3D VE through two different media: HMD and SPS. METHODS: Two groups of subjects participated (healthy control, n=10, aged 53.6 �� 17.2 yrs; stroke, n=20, 66.2 �� 11.3 yrs). Arm motor impairment and spasticity were assessed in the stroke group which was divided into mild (n=10) and moderate-to-severe (n=10) sub-groups based on Fugl-Meyer Scores. Subjects pointed (8 times each) to 6 randomly presented targets located at two heights in the ipsilateral, middle and contralateral arm workspaces. Movements were repeated in the same VE viewed using HMD (Kaiser XL50) and SPS. Movement kinematics were recorded using an Optotrak system (Certus, 6 markers, 100 Hz). Upper limb motor performance (precision, velocity, trajectory straightness) and movement pattern (elbow, shoulder ranges and trunk displacement) outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: For all groups, there were no differences in endpoint trajectory straightness, shoulder flexion and shoulder horizontal adduction ranges and sagittal trunk displacement between the two media. All subjects, however, made larger errors in the vertical direction using HMD compared to SPS. Healthy subjects also made larger errors in the sagittal direction, slower movements overall and used less range of elbow extension for the lower central target using HMD compared to SPS. The mild and moderate-to-severe sub-groups made larger RMS errors with HMD. The only advantage of using the HMD was that movements were 22% faster in the moderate-to-severe stroke sub-group compared to the SPS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similarity in majority of the movement kinematics, differences in movement speed and larger errors were observed for movements using the HMD. Use of the SPS may be a more comfortable and effective option to view VEs for upper limb rehabilitation post-stroke. This has implications for the use of VR applications to enhance upper limb recovery. �� 2011 Subramanian and Levin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,long,long,0,0,0-1,2427,426,1,True,f282e20e-e82b-49a8-f84d-6cb3d4481ee4,0-1,1366,577,1570972464701,,"{""21156053"":247,""21718542"":0,""27378656"":9}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:14:30.764Z""}]",,,,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da3232e1de93a011bbf69c4,0000749d26--5da3232e1de93a011bbf69c4,bace09725c01d5ec808ecf4555e56225,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:14:22.384,2019-10-13T13:18:54.364,2019-10-13T13:18:54.364,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,6.063,,6.063,2,0,True,3,0
21156053,Validation of a model-based virtual trials method for tight glycemic control in intensive care.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: In-silico virtual patients and trials offer significant advantages in cost, time and safety for designing effective tight glycemic control (TGC) protocols. However, no such method has fully validated the independence of virtual patients (or resulting clinical trial predictions) from the data used to create them. This study uses matched cohorts from a TGC clinical trial to validate virtual patients and in-silico virtual trial models and methods. METHODS: Data from a 211 patient subset of the Glucontrol trial in Liege, Belgium. Glucontrol-A (N = 142) targeted 4.4-6.1 mmol/L and Glucontrol-B (N = 69) targeted 7.8-10.0 mmol/L. Cohorts were matched by APACHE II score, initial BG, age, weight, BMI and sex (p > 0.25). Virtual patients are created by fitting a clinically validated model to clinical data, yielding time varying insulin sensitivity profiles (SI(t)) that drives in-silico patients.Model fit and intra-patient (forward) prediction errors are used to validate individual in-silico virtual patients. Self-validation (tests A protocol on Group-A virtual patients; and B protocol on B virtual patients) and cross-validation (tests A protocol on Group-B virtual patients; and B protocol on A virtual patients) are used in comparison to clinical data to assess ability to predict clinical trial results. RESULTS: Model fit errors were small (<0.25%) for all patients, indicating model fitness. Median forward prediction errors were: 4.3, 2.8 and 3.5% for Group-A, Group-B and Overall (A+B), indicating individual virtual patients were accurate representations of real patients. SI and its variability were similar between cohorts indicating they were metabolically similar.Self and cross validation results were within 1-10% of the clinical data for both Group-A and Group-B. Self-validation indicated clinically insignificant errors due to model and/or clinical compliance. Cross-validation clearly showed that virtual patients enabled by identified patient-specific SI(t) profiles can accurately predict the performance of independent and different TGC protocols. CONCLUSIONS: This study fully validates these virtual patients and in silico virtual trial methods, and clearly shows they can accurately simulate, in advance, the clinical results of a TGC protocol, enabling rapid in silico protocol design and optimization.

27378656,Restoring movement representation and alleviating phantom limb pain through short-term neurorehabilitation with a virtual reality system.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We developed a quantitative method to measure movement representations of a phantom upper limb using a bimanual circle-line coordination task (BCT). We investigated whether short-term neurorehabilitation with a virtual reality (VR) system would restore voluntary movement representations and alleviate phantom limb pain (PLP). METHODS: Eight PLP patients were enrolled. In the BCT, they repeatedly drew vertical lines using the intact hand and intended to draw circles using the phantom limb. Drawing circles mentally using the phantom limb led to the emergence of an oval transfiguration of the vertical lines ('bimanual-coupling' effect). We quantitatively measured the degree of this bimanual-coupling effect as movement representations of the phantom limb before and immediately after short-term VR neurorehabilitation. This was achieved using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for PLP intensity and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). During VR neurorehabilitation, patients wore a head-mounted display that showed a mirror-reversed computer graphic image of an intact arm (the virtual phantom limb). By intending to move both limbs simultaneously and similarly, the patients perceived voluntary execution of movement in their phantom limb. RESULTS: Short-term VR neurorehabilitation promptly restored voluntary movement representations in the BCT and alleviated PLP (NRS: p = 0.015; 39.1 ± 28.4% relief, SF-MPQ: p = 0.015; 61.5 ± 48.5% relief). Restoration of phantom limb movement representations and reduced PLP intensity were linearly correlated (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VR rehabilitation may encourage patient's motivation and multimodal sensorimotor re-integration of a phantom limb and subsequently have a potent analgesic effect. SIGNIFICANCE: There was no objective evidence that restoring movement representation by neurorehabilitation with virtual reality alleviated phantom limb pain. This study revealed quantitatively that restoring movement representation with virtual reality rehabilitation using a bimanual coordination task correlated with alleviation of phantom limb pain. © 2016 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.",,long,short,0,0,0-1,2185,349,1,True,f282e20e-e82b-49a8-f84d-6cb3d4481ee4,0-1,1366,577,1570972464701,,"{""21156053"":247,""21718542"":0,""27378656"":9}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:18:54.106Z""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da3232e1de93a011bbf69c4,0000749d26--5da3232e1de93a011bbf69c4,bace09725c01d5ec808ecf4555e56225,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:14:22.384,2019-10-13T13:18:54.364,2019-10-13T13:18:54.364,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,8.719,,8.719,2,0,True,3,9
29149855,Increasing upper limb training intensity in chronic stroke using embodied virtual reality: a pilot study.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. METHODS: Ten outpatient stroke survivors with chronic (>6��months) upper extremity paresis participated in a ten-session VR-based upper limb rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week). RESULTS: All participants completed all sessions of the treatment. In total, they received a median of 403��min of upper limb therapy, with 290��min of effective training. Within that time, participants performed a median of 4713 goal-directed movements. Importantly, training intensity increased progressively across sessions from 13.2 to 17.3 movements per minute. Clinical measures show that despite being in the chronic phase, where recovery potential is thought to be limited, participants showed a median improvement rate of 5.3% in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity; FMA-UE) post intervention compared to baseline, and of 15.4% at one-month follow-up. For three of them, this improvement was clinically significant. A significant improvement in shoulder active range of motion (AROM) was also observed at follow-up. Participants reported very low levels of pain, stress and fatigue following each session of training, indicating that the intensive VR intervention was well tolerated. No severe adverse events were reported. All participants expressed their interest in continuing the intervention at the hospital or even at home, suggesting high levels of adherence and motivation for the provided intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed how a dedicated VR system could deliver high rehabilitation doses and, importantly, intensive training in chronic stroke survivors. FMA-UE and AROM results suggest that task-specific VR training may be beneficial for further functional recovery both in the chronic stage of stroke. Longitudinal studies with higher doses and sample sizes are required to confirm the therapy effectiveness.

Targeted training may significantly improve postural stability by strengthening the remaining sensory systems. Here, we evaluate the Ashtanga-based Yoga Therapy (AYT) program as a multi-sensory behavioral intervention to develop postural stability in VI. DESIGN: A randomized, waitlist-controlled, single-blind clinical trial. METHODS: The trial was conducted between October 2012 and December 2013. Twenty-one legally blind participants were randomized to an 8-week AYT program (n = 11, mean (SD) age = 55(17)) or waitlist control (n=10, mean (SD) age = 55(10)). AYT subjects convened for one group session at a local yoga studio with an instructor and two individual home-based practice sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Subjects completed outcome measures at baseline and post-8 weeks of AYT. The primary outcome, absolute Center of Pressure (COP), was derived from the Wii Balance Board (WBB), a standalone posturography device, in 4 sensory conditions: firm surface, eyes open (EO); firm surface, eyes closed (EC); foam surface, EO; and foam surface, EC. Stabilization Indices (SI) were computed from COP measures to determine the relative visual (SIfirm, SIfoam), somatosensory (SIEO, SIEC) and vestibular (SIV, i.e., FoamEC vs. FirmEO) contributions to balance. This study was not powered to detect between group differences, so significance of pre-post changes was assessed by paired samples t-tests within each group. RESULTS: Groups were equivalent at baseline (all p > 0.05). In the AYT group, absolute COP significantly increased in the FoamEO (t(8) = -3.66, p = 0.01) and FoamEC (t(8) = -3.90, p = 0.01) conditions. Relative somatosensory SIEO (t(8) = -2.42, p = 0.04) and SIEC (t(8) = -3.96, p = 0.01), and vestibular SIV (t(8) = -2.47, p = 0.04) contributions to balance increased significantly. As expected, no significant changes from EO to EC conditions were found indicating an absence of visual dependency in VI. No significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results establish the potential for AYT training to develop the remaining somatosensory and vestibular responses used to optimize postural stability in a VI population.

We also wanted to investigate if playing computer games resulted in improved motor function in persons with prior stroke. METHODS: The intervention involved 11 patients after stroke who received extra rehabilitation by training on a computer 3 times a week during a 4-week period. The control group involved 11 patients after stroke who continued their previous rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period. The mean age of all was 68 years (range = 47-85) and the average time after stroke 66 months (range = 15-140). The VR training consisted of challenging games, which provided a range of difficulty levels that allow practice to be fun and motivating. An additional group of 11 right-handed aged matched individuals without history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses served as reference subjects. RESULTS: All the participants reported that they were novel computer game players. After an initial introduction they learned to use the VR system quickly. The treatment group demonstrated improvements in motor outcome for the trained upper extremity, but this was not detected in real-life activities.

Relative somatosensory SIEO (t(8) = -2.42, p = 0.04) and SIEC (t(8) = -3.96, p = 0.01), and vestibular SIV (t(8) = -2.47, p = 0.04) contributions to balance increased significantly. As expected, no significant changes from EO to EC conditions were found indicating an absence of visual dependency in VI. No significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results establish the potential for AYT training to develop the remaining somatosensory and vestibular responses used to optimize postural stability in a VI population.

27317506,Changing Behavioral Lifestyle Risk Factors Related to Cognitive Decline in Later Life Using a Self-Motivated eHealth Intervention in Dutch Adults.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults. METHODS: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage. RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95% CI 0.49-1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components. CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.

30866834,Effects of exergame training combined with omega-3 fatty acids on the elderly brain: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Older adults often suffer from age- and behavior-related brain changes affecting neuronal functioning and, therefore, cognitive and motor functions. The improvement of these functions might decrease falls and improve mobility. Previous studies indicate that video game-based physical exercise, so-called exergames, or omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) improve motor and cognitive functioning through brain adaptations. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exergame training combined with fish oil supplementation on neuronal system levels in the brain and behavioral measurements in older adults. We hypothesized that the combination would differently affect these factors compared to the sole administration of exergame. METHODS: Fifty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (N = 29 each group) in a parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. The experimental group received daily fish oil, whereas the control group received daily olive oil. After 16 weeks, both groups started with an exergame training. Measurements were performed pre, during, and post intervention. Primary outcomes were recruitment curves using transcranial magnetic stimulation and response-locked potentials using electroencephalography. Secondary outcomes included executive functions and gait parameters. Blood samples were taken to control for FAs. RESULTS: Forty-three individuals (mean age 69.4 ± 4.6 years) completed the study (Nexperimental = 22, Ncontrol = 21). The results showed no significant time × group interaction effects for any parameters. Blood samples demonstrated significant time × group interaction effects. Post-hoc tests showed a significant increase of omega-3 FAs (p < .001) and a significant decrease of omega-6 FAs (p < .001) for the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The combination of exergame training and fish oil did not lead to additional beneficial effects. To trigger possible effects, future studies should carefully consider study design aspects; e.g. study duration, individual nutritional supplementation dose, omega-3 FAs supplementation composition, and placebo. Furthermore, studies should consider neuroimaging methods as these might be more sensitive to assess early brain adaptations. Thus, future studies should be aware of several aspects running a combinatory study that includes omega-3 FAs according to their expected effects.

Imbalance appears in most people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). A popular balance training tool is virtual reality (VR) with several advantages including increased compliance and user satisfaction. Therefore, the aim of this pilot RCT (Trial registration number, date: ISRCTN14425615, 21/01/2016) was to examine the efficacy of a 6-week VR balance training program using the computer assisted rehabilitation environment (CAREN) system (Motek Medical BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands) on balance measures in PwMS. Results were compared with those of a conventional balance exercise group. Secondary aims included the impact of this program on the fear of falling. METHODS: Thirty-two PwMS were equally randomized into the VR intervention group or the control group. Each group received balance training sessions for 6 consecutive weeks, two sessions per week, 30��min sessions.

Targeted training may significantly improve postural stability by strengthening the remaining sensory systems. Here, we evaluate the Ashtanga-based Yoga Therapy (AYT) program as a multi-sensory behavioral intervention to develop postural stability in VI. DESIGN: A randomized, waitlist-controlled, single-blind clinical trial. METHODS: The trial was conducted between October 2012 and December 2013. Twenty-one legally blind participants were randomized to an 8-week AYT program (n = 11, mean (SD) age = 55(17)) or waitlist control (n=10, mean (SD) age = 55(10)). AYT subjects convened for one group session at a local yoga studio with an instructor and two individual home-based practice sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Subjects completed outcome measures at baseline and post-8 weeks of AYT. The primary outcome, absolute Center of Pressure (COP), was derived from the Wii Balance Board (WBB), a standalone posturography device, in 4 sensory conditions: firm surface, eyes open (EO); firm surface, eyes closed (EC); foam surface, EO; and foam surface, EC. Stabilization Indices (SI) were computed from COP measures to determine the relative visual (SIfirm, SIfoam), somatosensory (SIEO, SIEC) and vestibular (SIV, i.e., FoamEC vs. FirmEO) contributions to balance. This study was not powered to detect between group differences, so significance of pre-post changes was assessed by paired samples t-tests within each group. RESULTS: Groups were equivalent at baseline (all p > 0.05). In the AYT group, absolute COP significantly increased in the FoamEO (t(8) = -3.66, p = 0.01) and FoamEC (t(8) = -3.90, p = 0.01) conditions. Relative somatosensory SIEO (t(8) = -2.42, p = 0.04) and SIEC (t(8) = -3.96, p = 0.01), and vestibular SIV (t(8) = -2.47, p = 0.04) contributions to balance increased significantly. As expected, no significant changes from EO to EC conditions were found indicating an absence of visual dependency in VI. No significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group (all p > 0.05).

25805886,"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neurocognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.",molina-2014,0,1.0,,"Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; treatment as usual; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment. Participants completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2 peak ml/kg/min), neurocognition (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), and serum-BDNF before and after and 12-week period. Twenty-six participants (79%) completed the study. At follow-up, the AE participants improved their AF by 18.0% vs a -0.5% decline in the TAU group (P = .002) and improved their neurocognition by 15.1% vs -2.0% decline in the TAU group (P = .031). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that enhancement in AF and increases in BDNF predicted 25.4% and 14.6% of the neurocognitive improvement variance, respectively. The results indicate AE is effective in enhancing neurocognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia and provide preliminary support for the impact of AE-related BDNF up-regulation on neurocognition in this population. Poor AF represents a modifiable risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia for which AE training offer a safe, nonstigmatizing, and side-effect-free intervention.  © The Author 2015.

Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to examine training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps and biceps activation during reaching tasks in stroke survivors with severe paresis in the chronic stage of recovery. The EMG data were obtained in the context of a single blind randomised clinical trial conducted with 42 stroke survivors with minimal upper limb muscle activity and who were more than 6 months post-stroke. Of the 33 participants who completed the study, 10 received training of reaching using a non-robotic upper limb training device, the SMART Arm, with EMG triggered functional electrical stimulation (EMG-stim), 13 received training of reaching using the SMART Arm alone, and 10 received no intervention. Each intervention group engaged in 12 1-h training sessions over a 4-week period. Clinical and laboratory measures of upper limb function were administered prior to training (0 weeks), at completion (4 weeks) and 2 months (12 weeks) after training. The primary outcome measure was 'upper arm function' which is Item 6 of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS). Laboratory measures consisted of two multijoint reaching tasks to assess 'maximum isometric force' and 'maximum distance reached'. Surface EMG was used to monitor triceps brachii and biceps brachii during the two reaching tasks. To provide a comparison with normal values, seven healthy adults were tested on one of the reaching tasks according to the same procedure. Study findings demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in upper limb function for stroke participants in the two training groups compared to those who received no training however no difference was found between the two training groups. For the reaching tasks, all stroke participants, when compared to normal healthy adults, exhibited lower triceps and biceps activation and a lower ratio of triceps to biceps activation. Following training, stroke participants demonstrated increased triceps activation and an increased ratio of triceps to biceps activation for the task that was trained. Better performance was associated with greater triceps activation and a higher ratio of triceps to biceps activation. The findings suggest that increased activation of triceps as an agonist and an improved coordination between triceps and biceps could have mediated the observed changes in arm function. The changes in EMG activity were small relative to the changes in arm function indicating that factors, such as the contribution of other muscles of reaching, may also be implicated.",,long,long,0,0,0-0,2701,452,1,False,108a8be1-694d-4834-e86a-5d27db7d2280,0-0,1280,577,1570972713151,,"{""19504088"":10,""25135003"":4,""30866834"":0}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T13:19:34.970Z""}]",,,7.0,,0-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da324276126f3011ff5f9e5,0000749d26--5da324276126f3011ff5f9e5,a44275648e47dd57f9a71a40a57a56fc,APPROVED,2019-10-13T13:18:31.866,2019-10-13T13:19:39.843,2019-10-13T13:19:39.843,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,32.797,,32.797,2,0,True,2,10

METHOD: The study was set in a senior citizens' club in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The participants were 36 community-dwelling older women. Participants were randomly divided into either a group undertaking balance-focused virtual-reality games or a group doing therapeutic balance exercises. The program lasted 6 weeks and was conducted twice a week for 40 min during each session.

We investigated the beneficial effects of the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with virtual reality (VR) motor training. METHODS: In total, 15 healthy, right-handed volunteers and 15 patients with stroke in the subacute stage participated. Four different conditions (A: active wrist exercise, B: VR wrist exercise, C: VR wrist exercise following anodal tDCS (1 mV, 20 min) on the left (healthy volunteer) or affected (stroke patient) primary motor cortex, and D: anodal tDCS without exercise) were provided in random order on separate days. We compared during and post-exercise corticospinal excitability under different conditions in healthy volunteers (A, B, C, D) and stroke patients (B, C, D) by measuring the changes in amplitudes of motor evoked potentials in the extensor carpi radialis muscle, elicited with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. For statistical analyses, a linear mixed model for a repeated-measures covariance pattern model with unstructured covariance within groups (healthy or stroke groups) was used. RESULTS: The VR wrist exercise (B) facilitated post-exercise corticospinal excitability more than the active wrist exercise (A) or anodal tDCS without exercise (D) in healthy volunteers. Moreover, the post-exercise corticospinal facilitation after tDCS and VR exercise (C) was greater and was sustained for 20 min after exercise versus the other conditions in healthy volunteers (A, B, D) and in subacute stroke patients (B, D). CONCLUSIONS: The combined effect of VR motor training following tDCS was synergistic and short-term corticospinal facilitation was superior to the application of VR training, active motor training, or tDCS without exercise condition.

30866834,Effects of exergame training combined with omega-3 fatty acids on the elderly brain: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Older adults often suffer from age- and behavior-related brain changes affecting neuronal functioning and, therefore, cognitive and motor functions. The improvement of these functions might decrease falls and improve mobility. Previous studies indicate that video game-based physical exercise, so-called exergames, or omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) improve motor and cognitive functioning through brain adaptations. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exergame training combined with fish oil supplementation on neuronal system levels in the brain and behavioral measurements in older adults. We hypothesized that the combination would differently affect these factors compared to the sole administration of exergame. METHODS: Fifty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (N = 29 each group) in a parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. The experimental group received daily fish oil, whereas the control group received daily olive oil. After 16 weeks, both groups started with an exergame training. Measurements were performed pre, during, and post intervention. Primary outcomes were recruitment curves using transcranial magnetic stimulation and response-locked potentials using electroencephalography. Secondary outcomes included executive functions and gait parameters. Blood samples were taken to control for FAs. RESULTS: Forty-three individuals (mean age 69.4 ± 4.6 years) completed the study (Nexperimental = 22, Ncontrol = 21). The results showed no significant time × group interaction effects for any parameters. Blood samples demonstrated significant time × group interaction effects. Post-hoc tests showed a significant increase of omega-3 FAs (p < .001) and a significant decrease of omega-6 FAs (p < .001) for the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The combination of exergame training and fish oil did not lead to additional beneficial effects. To trigger possible effects, future studies should carefully consider study design aspects; e.g. study duration, individual nutritional supplementation dose, omega-3 FAs supplementation composition, and placebo. Furthermore, studies should consider neuroimaging methods as these might be more sensitive to assess early brain adaptations.

Exergames can be an appealing alternative to enhance exercise engagement and compliance, whilst improving physical fitness and motor function. This study aims to analyse the effects of a Wii-based exercise program on physical fitness, functional mobility and motor proficiency of adults with DS. METHODS: Twenty-seven adults with DS were randomly allocated to an experimental group (Wii; n = 14) or control group (n = 13). Participants in the experimental group completed a 2-month Wii-based exercise program, with three 1-h sessions per week that included training games for aerobic endurance, balance and isometric strength. Participants completed assessments regarding anthropometric measures, physical fitness, functional mobility and motor proficiency. RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA analysis showed a significant group by time interaction for aerobic endurance, explosive leg power and flexibility. Independent samples t-test for change scores indicated significant between-group differences favouring the experimental group regarding speed of limb movement, trunk strength and functional mobility, as well as a trend towards significance on body weight. Mann-Whitney's U test for change scores demonstrated between-group differences favouring the experimental group for visceral fat as well as running speed and agility. Large within-group effect sizes were observed for explosive leg power (d = 1.691), body weight (d = 1.281), functional mobility (d = 1.218), aerobic endurance (d = 1.020), speed of limb movement (d = 0.867) and flexibility (d = 0.818) in the experimental group.

1008,3-D streaming supplying partner protocols for mobile collaborative exergaming for health,pubmed,1,1.0,,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data.

19563680,"Rationale, design and methods for a randomised and controlled trial to investigate whether home access to electronic games decreases children's physical activity.",molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Many children are reported to have insufficient physical activity (PA) placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Participating in sedentary activities such as playing electronic games is widely believed to contribute to less PA. However there is no experimental evidence that playing electronic games reduces PA. There is also no evidence regarding the effect of different types of electronic games (traditional sedentary electronic games versus new active input electronic games) on PA. Further, there is a poor understanding about how characteristics of children may moderate the impact of electronic game access on PA and about what leisure activities are displaced when children play electronic games. Given that many children play electronic games, a better understanding of the effect of electronic game use on PA is critical to inform child health policy and intervention. METHODS: This randomised and controlled trial will examine whether PA is decreased by access to electronic games and whether any effect is dependent on the type of game input or the child's characteristics. Children aged 10-12 years (N = 72, 36 females) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of 'no electronic games', 'traditional' electronic games and 'active' electronic games. Each child will participate in each condition for 8 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is PA, assessed by Actical accelerometers worn for 7 days on the wrist and hip. Energy expenditure will be assessed by the doubly labelled water technique and motor coordination, adiposity, self-confidence, attitudes to technology and PA and leisure activities will also be assessed. A sample of 72 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 15 mins difference in PA (sd = 30 mins). DISCUSSION: This is the first such trial and will provide critical information to understand whether access to electronic games affects children's PA. Given the vital importance of adequate PA to a healthy start to life and establishing patterns which may track into adulthood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of children.

The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS: Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed Up & Go Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures. CONCLUSION: Dynamic balance exercises on fixed and compliant sponge surfaces were feasibly coupled to interactive game-based exercise. This coupling, in turn, resulted in a greater improvement in dynamic standing balance control compared with the typical exercise program. However, there was no transfer of effect to gait function.",,long,long,0,1,1-0,2592,414,1,True,8d32639b-9e02-4eca-f073-8699f9aae852,x-x,1280,530,1570979688643,,"{""19563680"":2,""21799138"":0,""28585394"":0}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:15:10.886Z""}]",,,2.0,,1-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da33e624c8219010d99ffd3,0000749d26--5da33e624c8219010d99ffd3,393fae4c3ba1e3caf41aa14599a18469,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:10:26.408,2019-10-13T15:11:10.986,2019-10-13T15:11:10.986,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,7.688,,7.688,1,0,False,1,0
19563680,"Rationale, design and methods for a randomised and controlled trial to investigate whether home access to electronic games decreases children's physical activity.",molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Many children are reported to have insufficient physical activity (PA) placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Participating in sedentary activities such as playing electronic games is widely believed to contribute to less PA. However there is no experimental evidence that playing electronic games reduces PA. There is also no evidence regarding the effect of different types of electronic games (traditional sedentary electronic games versus new active input electronic games) on PA. Further, there is a poor understanding about how characteristics of children may moderate the impact of electronic game access on PA and about what leisure activities are displaced when children play electronic games. Given that many children play electronic games, a better understanding of the effect of electronic game use on PA is critical to inform child health policy and intervention. METHODS: This randomised and controlled trial will examine whether PA is decreased by access to electronic games and whether any effect is dependent on the type of game input or the child's characteristics. Children aged 10-12 years (N = 72, 36 females) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of 'no electronic games', 'traditional' electronic games and 'active' electronic games. Each child will participate in each condition for 8 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is PA, assessed by Actical accelerometers worn for 7 days on the wrist and hip. Energy expenditure will be assessed by the doubly labelled water technique and motor coordination, adiposity, self-confidence, attitudes to technology and PA and leisure activities will also be assessed. A sample of 72 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 15 mins difference in PA (sd = 30 mins). DISCUSSION: This is the first such trial and will provide critical information to understand whether access to electronic games affects children's PA. Given the vital importance of adequate PA to a healthy start to life and establishing patterns which may track into adulthood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of children.

28585394,"Wii-based exercise program to improve physical fitness, motor proficiency and functional mobility in adults with Down syndrome.",molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome (DS) usually display reduced physical fitness (aerobic capacity, muscle strength and abnormal body composition), motor proficiency impairments (balance and postural control) and physical functional limitations. Exergames can be an appealing alternative to enhance exercise engagement and compliance, whilst improving physical fitness and motor function. This study aims to analyse the effects of a Wii-based exercise program on physical fitness, functional mobility and motor proficiency of adults with DS. METHODS: Twenty-seven adults with DS were randomly allocated to an experimental group (Wii; n = 14) or control group (n = 13). Participants in the experimental group completed a 2-month Wii-based exercise program, with three 1-h sessions per week that included training games for aerobic endurance, balance and isometric strength. Participants completed assessments regarding anthropometric measures, physical fitness, functional mobility and motor proficiency. RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA analysis showed a significant group by time interaction for aerobic endurance, explosive leg power and flexibility. Independent samples t-test for change scores indicated significant between-group differences favouring the experimental group regarding speed of limb movement, trunk strength and functional mobility, as well as a trend towards significance on body weight. Mann-Whitney's U test for change scores demonstrated between-group differences favouring the experimental group for visceral fat as well as running speed and agility. Large within-group effect sizes were observed for explosive leg power (d = 1.691), body weight (d = 1.281), functional mobility (d = 1.218), aerobic endurance (d = 1.020), speed of limb movement (d = 0.867) and flexibility (d = 0.818) in the experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Wii-based exercise can be an effective tool to improve physical fitness, functional mobility and motor proficiency of adults with DS, including crucial measures such as aerobic capacity and lower limb strength. Exergames using Wii Fit or other equipment can be appealing alternatives for adults with DS to engage in regular physical activity, preventing sedentary behaviour and decreasing the risk to develop cardiovascular diseases. © 2017 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,long,long,0,1,1-0,2443,404,1,True,00b90b67-7b88-63b0-cab2-f718022d9943,1-0,1537,748,1570979448609,,"{""19563680"":74,""24597650"":78,""28585394"":74}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:12:18.083Z""}]",,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da33e77f5a076011de4cb4e,0000749d26--5da33e77f5a076011de4cb4e,40daaa16233cd1184a622708cb1de216,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:10:47.384,2019-10-13T15:17:16.440,2019-10-13T15:17:16.440,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,60.374,,60.374,1,0,True,2,74

1058,Three-dimensional head-mounted gaming task procedure maximizes effects of vestibular rehabilitation in unilateral vestibular hypofunction: A randomized controlled pilot trial,scopus,1,,1.0,"Considering the emerging advantages related to virtual reality implementation in clinical rehabilitation, the aim of the present study was to discover possible (i) improvements achievable in unilateral vestibular hypofunction patients using a self-assessed head-mounted device (HMD)-based gaming procedure when combined with a classical vestibular rehabilitation protocol (HMD group) as compared with a group undergoing only vestibular rehabilitation and (ii) HMD procedure-related side effects. Therefore, 24 vestibular rehabilitation and 23-matched HMD unilateral vestibular hypofunction individuals simultaneously underwent a 4-week rehabilitation protocol. Both otoneurological measures (vestibulo-ocular reflex gain and postural arrangement by studying both posturography parameters and spectral values of body oscillation) and performance and self-report measures (Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory; Activitiesspecific Balance Confidence scale; Zung Instrument for Anxiety Disorders, Dynamic Gait Index; and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire) were analyzed by means of a between-group/within-subject analysis of variance model. A significant post-treatment between-effect was found, and the HMD group demonstrated an overall improvement in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain on the lesional side, in posturography parameters, in low-frequency spectral domain, as well as in Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale scores. Meanwhile, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms related to experimental home-based gaming tasks during the HMD procedure. Our findings revealed the possible advantages of HMD implementation in vestibular rehabilitation, suggesting it as an innovative, self-assessed, low-cost, and compliant tool useful in maximizing vestibular rehabilitation outcomes. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people. METHODS/DESIGN: This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

Therefore, 24 vestibular rehabilitation and 23-matched HMD unilateral vestibular hypofunction individuals simultaneously underwent a 4-week rehabilitation protocol. Both otoneurological measures (vestibulo-ocular reflex gain and postural arrangement by studying both posturography parameters and spectral values of body oscillation) and performance and self-report measures (Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory; Activitiesspecific Balance Confidence scale; Zung Instrument for Anxiety Disorders, Dynamic Gait Index; and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire) were analyzed by means of a between-group/within-subject analysis of variance model. A significant post-treatment between-effect was found, and the HMD group demonstrated an overall improvement in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain on the lesional side, in posturography parameters, in low-frequency spectral domain, as well as in Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale scores. Meanwhile, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms related to experimental home-based gaming tasks during the HMD procedure. Our findings revealed the possible advantages of HMD implementation in vestibular rehabilitation, suggesting it as an innovative, self-assessed, low-cost, and compliant tool useful in maximizing vestibular rehabilitation outcomes. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

26849537,"Effects of Exergames on Balance, Functional Mobility, and Quality of Life of Geriatrics Versus Home Exercise Programme: Randomized Controlled Study.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"AIM: To compare the effects of exergames (EGs) using the Xbox Kinect™ device and home exercise (HE) on balance, functional mobility, and quality of life of individuals aged 65 years or older. METHOD: One hundred participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to the EG or HE group. The EG group took part in a 6-week programme using the Xbox360Kinect™ device, and the HE group took part in a 6-week balance exercise programme at home 5 days a week. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to assess balance, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to evaluate functional walking, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to assess quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants in the EG group and 42 participants in the HE group completed the study. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and pretreatment values of BBS, TUG, and SF-36. Although the BBS scores of both groups improved significantly (all p<0.05), the post-treatment scores of the EG group were better than those of the HE group. The TUG scores improved only in the EG group (p<0.05). The increase in the BBS scores and decrease in the TUG test scores were significant only in the EG group (all p<0.05). A significant improvement was also observed in the quality of life parameters of physical functioning, social role functioning, physical role restriction, general health perceptions, and physical component scores in the post-exercise evaluations of the EG group. The participants commented that they found the EG programme very entertaining. CONCLUSION: The EG can be considered a safe, entertaining and sustainable alternative to HE programmes, and it may have positive effects on balance, functional walking and quality of life in geriatric subjects.

21851587,"Rationale, design and methods for a randomised and controlled trial of the impact of virtual reality games on motor competence, physical activity, and mental health in children with developmental coordination disorder.",molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: A healthy start to life requires adequate motor development and physical activity participation. Currently 5-15% of children have impaired motor development without any obvious disorder. These children are at greater risk of obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, low social confidence and poor mental health. Traditional electronic game use may impact on motor development and physical activity creating a vicious cycle. However new virtual reality (VR) game interfaces may provide motor experiences that enhance motor development and lead to an increase in motor coordination and better physical activity and mental health outcomes. VR games are beginning to be used for rehabilitation, however there is no reported trial of the impact of these games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. METHODS: This cross-over randomised and controlled trial will examine whether motor coordination is enhanced by access to active electronic games and whether daily activity, attitudes to physical activity and mental health are also enhanced. Thirty children aged 10-12 years with poor motor coordination (��� 15th percentile) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of 'no active electronic games' and 'active electronic games'. Each child will participate in both conditions for 16 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is motor coordination, assessed by kinematic and kinetic motion analysis laboratory measures. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be assessed by accelerometry, coordination in daily life by parent report questionnaire and attitudes to physical activity, self-confidence, anxiety and depressed mood will be assessed by self report questionnaire. A sample of 30 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 5 point difference in motor coordination on the MABC-2 TIS scale (mean 17, sd = 5). DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to examine the impact of new virtual reality games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. The findings will provide critical information to understand whether these electronic games can be used to have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of these children. Given the importance of adequate motor coordination, physical activity and mental health in childhood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of this group of children.

22920811,Neuropsychological benefits of stationary bike exercise and a cybercycle exergame for older adults with diabetes: an exploratory analysis.,vazquez-2018,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated neuropsychological effects of exercise among older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with adults without diabetes (non-DM), and it examined the feasibility of using a stationary bike exergame as a form of exercise for older adults with and without diabetes. It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. METHODS: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a cybercycle with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them exercisers and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group × time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity. © 2012 Diabetes Technology Society.",,long,long,1,1,1-1,2795,484,1,True,851af4f6-c90f-1d1b-9682-8d67aaecc425,x-x,360,451,1570979912943,,"{""1060"":7,""21851587"":7,""22920811"":5}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:21:24.233Z""},{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:21:25.192Z""}]",,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da34047c658210120392fa1,0000749d26--5da34047c658210120392fa1,617b2a3a0da5a1cf9c7ec69dab37de86,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:18:31.418,2019-10-13T15:22:48.233,2019-10-13T15:22:48.233,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,74.169,,74.169,2,1,False,6,5
1060,"Experiencing nature through immersive virtual environments: Environmental perceptions, physical engagement, and affective responses during a simulated nature walk",scopus,1,1.0,,"By combining physical activity and exposure to nature, green exercise can provide additional health benefits compared to physical activity alone. Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) have emerged as a potentially valuable supplement to environmental and behavioral research, and might also provide new approaches to green exercise promotion. However, it is unknown to what extent green exercise in IVE can provide psychophysiological responses similar to those experienced in real natural environments. In this study, 26 healthy adults underwent three experimental conditions: nature walk, sitting-IVE, and treadmill-IVE. The nature walk took place on a paved trail along a large river. In the IVE conditions, the participants wore a head-mounted display with headphones reproducing a 360° video and audio of the nature walk, either sitting on a chair or walking on a manually driven treadmill. Measurements included environmental perceptions (presence and perceived environmental restorativeness - PER), physical engagement (walking speed, heart rate, and perceived exertion), and affective responses (enjoyment and affect). Additionally, qualitative information was collected through open-ended questions. The participants rated the IVEs with satisfactory levels of 'being there' and 'sense of reality,' but also reported discomforts such as 'flatness,' 'movement lag' and 'cyber sickness.' With equivalent heart rate and walking speed, participants reported higher perceived exertion in the IVEs than in the nature walk. The nature walk was associated with high enjoyment and enhanced affect. However, despite equivalent ratings of PER in the nature walk and in the IVEs, the latter were perceived as less enjoyable and gave rise to a poorer affect. Presence and PER did not differ between the two IVEs, although in the treadmill-IVE the negative affective responses had slightly smaller magnitude than in the sitting-IVE. In both the IVEs, the negative affective responses were mainly associated with cyber sickness, whereas PER was positively associated with enjoyment. From the qualitative analysis, it emerged that poor postural control and lack of a holistic sensory experience can also hinder immersion in the IVE. The results indicate that IVE technology might in future be a useful instrument in green exercise research and promotion, but only if image quality and cyber sickness can be addressed. © 2018 Calogiuri, Litleskare, Fagerheim, Rydgren, Brambilla and Thurston.",,long,short,0,0,0-1,2482,361,1,False,851af4f6-c90f-1d1b-9682-8d67aaecc425,0-1,360,451,1570979912943,,"{""1060"":7,""21851587"":7,""22920811"":5}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:22:45.872Z""}]",,,4.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da34047c658210120392fa1,0000749d26--5da34047c658210120392fa1,617b2a3a0da5a1cf9c7ec69dab37de86,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:18:31.418,2019-10-13T15:22:48.233,2019-10-13T15:22:48.233,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,80.68,,80.68,2,0,True,6,7

The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of older individuals with an intellectual disability with at least one prescription error and (2) to identify potential risk factors for these prescription errors (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frailty index, level of intellectual disability and living situation). The study population consisted of 600 older (≥ 50 years) individuals with an ID using one or more drugs who were randomly selected from the study cohort of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) Study. The medication used at the time of measurement was screened for errors by a hospital pharmacist/clinical pharmacologist and a Master's student pharmacy using consensus methodology. Participants with one or more prescription errors were compared to participants without prescription errors by multivariate logistic regression to identify potential risk factors. The prevalence of individuals with one or more prescription errors was 47.5% (285 of 600 individuals; 95% confidence interval (CI) 43-52%). Relevant errors, defined as errors that actually do require a change of pharmacotherapy, were identified in 26.8% of the individuals (161 of 600 individuals; 95% CI 23-30%).

OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness depends on adherence, so did patients use the intervention to the recommended level? If not, what reasons did they give? The purpose of this study was to investigate these and related questions. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, plus qualitative analysis of interviews, was conducted. METHODS: Seventeen patients recovering from stroke recruited to the intervention arm of a feasibility trial had the equipment left in their homes for 8 weeks and were advised to use it 3 times a day for periods of no more than 20 minutes. Frequency and duration of use were automatically recorded. At the end of the intervention, participants were interviewed to determine barriers to using it in the recommended way. RESULTS: Duration of use and how many days they used the equipment are presented for the 13 participants who successfully started the intervention. These figures were highly variable and could fall far short of our recommendations. There was a weak positive correlation between duration and baseline reported activities of daily living. Participants reported lack of familiarity with technology and competing commitments as barriers to use, although they appreciated the flexibility of the intervention and found it motivating. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Level of use is variable and can fall far short of recommendations. Competing commitments were a barrier to use of the equipment, but participants reported that the intervention was flexible and motivating.

1011,Alien Health Game: An Embodied Exergame to Instruct in Nutrition and MyPlate,pubmed,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: A feasibility study was run on an immersive, embodied exergame (Alien Health Game) designed to teach 4th-12th-grade students about nutrition and several U.S. Department of Agriculture MyPlate guidelines. This study assessed acceptability and limited efficacy. Students learned about the amount of nutrients and optimizers in common food items and practiced making rapid food choices while engaging in short cardiovascular activities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nineteen 4th graders played a mixed reality game that included both digital components (projected graphics on the floor) and tangible, physical components (hand-held motion-tracking wands). Players made food choices and experienced immediate feedback on how each item affected the Alien avatar's alertness/health state. One member of the playing dyad had to run short distances to make the game work. The final level included a digital projection of the MyPlate icon, and each food item filled the appropriate quadrant dynamically. RESULTS: All students remained engaged with the game after approximately 1 hour of play. Significant learning gains were seen on a pretest and posttest that assessed nutrition knowledge (paired t18=4.13, P<0.001). In addition, significant learning gains were also seen in knowledge regarding MyPlate (paired t18=3.29, P<0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest preliminary feasibility via demonstrated acceptability and improved within-group content knowledge.

31464194,Effects of Full Body Exergaming in Virtual Reality on Cardiovascular and Muscular Parameters: Cross-Sectional Experiment,pubmed,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, many studies have associated sedentary behavior in front of screens with health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Yet options for exergaming-playing video games that require rigorous physical exercise-seem to fall short of the physical activity levels recommended by the World Health Organization. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a fully immersive virtual reality (VR)-based training system on cardiovascular and muscular parameters of young adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional experiment design was used to analyze muscle activity (surface electromyography), heart rate, perceived exertion (RPE), cybersickness symptoms, perceived workload, and physical activity enjoyment (PACES) in 33 participants performing two 5-minute flights on a new training device. RESULTS: Participants' performance of the planking position required to play the game resulted in moderate aerobic intensity (108 [SD 18.69] bpm). Due to the mainly isometric contraction of the dorsal muscle chain (with a mean activation between 20.6% [SD 10.57] and 26.7% [SD 17.39] maximum voluntary isometric contraction), participants described the exercise as a moderate to vigorous activity (RPE 14.6 [SD 1.82]). The majority reported that they enjoyed the exercise (PACES 3.74 [SD 0.16]). However, six participants had to drop out because of cybersickness symptoms and two because of muscle pain due to prior injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fully immersive VR training systems can contribute to muscle-strengthening activities for healthy users. However, the dropout rate highlights the need for technological improvements in both software and hardware. In prevention and therapy, movement quality is a fundamental part of providing effective resistance training that benefits health. Exergaming on a regular basis has the potential to develop strong muscles and a healthy back. It is essential that future VR-based training systems take into account the recommendations of sport and exercise science. ©Boris Feodoroff, Ippokratis Konstantinidis, Ingo Froböse.

25141850,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): study protocol for an international multicenter randomized controlled trial.,vazquez-2018,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Falls are very common, especially in adults aged 65 years and older. Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people. METHODS/DESIGN: This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

METHODS: The system table tilted to adjust arm gravity loading. Participants wore arm supports that sensed grasp strength and wrist position on the table. Wrist weights further increased shoulder exertion. Games were designed to improve UE strength, motor function, cognition and emotive state and adapted automatically to each participant. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 8 weeks in two skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Participants were evaluated pre-therapy and post-therapy using standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach, table tilt and number of arm repetitions were stored on a remote server. OUTCOMES: Seven participants had significant improvements in their active range of shoulder movement, supported arm reach, shoulder strength, grasp strength and their ability to focus. The group demonstrated higher arm function measured with FMA (p���=���0.01) and CAHAI (p���=���0.05), and had an improvement in depression (Becks Depression Inventory, II). BrightArm Duo technology was well accepted by participants with a rating of 4.4 out of 5 points. CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, it will be beneficial to evaluate the BrightArm Duo application in SNF maintenance programs. Implications for Rehabilitation Integrative rehabilitation that addresses both physical and cognitive domains is promising for post-stroke maintenance in skilled nursing facilities.

17584501,Aging and selective sensorimotor strategies in the regulation of upright balance.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: The maintenance of upright equilibrium is essentially a sensorimotor integration task. The central nervous system (CNS) has to generate appropriate and complex motor responses based on the selective and rapid integration of sensory information from multiple sources. Since each sensory system has its own coordinate framework, specific time delay and reliability, sensory conflicts may arise and represent situations in which the CNS has to recalibrate the weight attributed to each particular sensory input. The resolution of sensory conflicts may represent a particular challenge for older adults given the age-related decline in the integrity of many postural regulating systems, including musculoskeletal and sensory systems, as well as neural processing and conduction of information. The effects of aging and adaptation (by repeated exposures) on the capability of the CNS to select pertinent sensory information and resolve sensory conflicts were thus investigated with virtual reality (VR) in the present study. METHODS: Healthy young and older adults maintained quiet stance while immersed in a virtual environment (VE) for 1 hour during which transient visual and/or surface perturbations were randomly presented. Visual perturbations were induced by sudden pitch or roll plane tilts of the VE viewed through a helmet-mounted display, and combined with or without surface perturbations presented in a direction that was either identical or opposite to the visual perturbations. RESULTS: Results showed a profound influence of aging on postural adjustments measured by electromyographic (EMG) responses and displacements of the center of pressure (COP) and body's center of mass (COM) in the recovery of upright stance, especially in the presence of sensory conflicts. Older adults relied more on vision as compared to young adults. Aging affects the interaction of the somatosensory and visual systems on the control of equilibrium during standing and the ability of CNS to resolve sensory conflicts. However, even with a one-hour immersion in VE and exposure to sensory conflicts, it is possible for the CNS to recalibrate and adapt to the changes, while improving balance capability in older adults. CONCLUSION: Preventive and rehabilitation programs targeting postural control in older adults should take into account the possible impairment of sensory organization or sensorimotor integration and include VE training under conditions of sensory conflicts.",,long,long,0,0,0-1,2481,403,1,True,851af4f6-c90f-1d1b-9682-8d67aaecc425,0-1,360,451,1570980430764,,"{""17584501"":2,""26218427"":13,""26911438"":4}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:30:28.991Z""}]",,,5.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da3424c046a7701203f65fc,0000749d26--5da3424c046a7701203f65fc,617b2a3a0da5a1cf9c7ec69dab37de86,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:27:08.725,2019-10-13T15:31:49.331,2019-10-13T15:31:49.331,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,102.774,,102.774,4,0,True,6,2

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of VR-based rehabilitation combined with standard occupational therapy on distal upper extremity function and HRQoL, and compare the findings to those of amount-matched conventional rehabilitation in stroke survivors. METHODS: The present study was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The study included 46 stroke survivors who were randomized to a Smart Glove (SG) group or a conventional intervention (CON) group. In both groups, the interventions were targeted to the distal upper extremity and standard occupational therapy was administered. The primary outcome was the change in the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM) scores, and the secondary outcomes were the changes in the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), Purdue pegboard test, and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores. The outcomes were assessed before the intervention, in the middle of the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1��month after the intervention. RESULTS: The improvements in the FM (FM-total, FM-prox, and FM-dist), JTT (JTT-total and JTT-gross), and SIS (composite and overall SIS, SIS-social participation, and SIS-mobility) scores were significantly greater in the SG group than in the CON group.

1008,3-D streaming supplying partner protocols for mobile collaborative exergaming for health,pubmed,1,1.0,,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data.

21851587,"Rationale, design and methods for a randomised and controlled trial of the impact of virtual reality games on motor competence, physical activity, and mental health in children with developmental coordination disorder.",molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: A healthy start to life requires adequate motor development and physical activity participation. Currently 5-15% of children have impaired motor development without any obvious disorder. These children are at greater risk of obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, low social confidence and poor mental health. Traditional electronic game use may impact on motor development and physical activity creating a vicious cycle. However new virtual reality (VR) game interfaces may provide motor experiences that enhance motor development and lead to an increase in motor coordination and better physical activity and mental health outcomes. VR games are beginning to be used for rehabilitation, however there is no reported trial of the impact of these games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. METHODS: This cross-over randomised and controlled trial will examine whether motor coordination is enhanced by access to active electronic games and whether daily activity, attitudes to physical activity and mental health are also enhanced. Thirty children aged 10-12 years with poor motor coordination (��� 15th percentile) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of 'no active electronic games' and 'active electronic games'. Each child will participate in both conditions for 16 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is motor coordination, assessed by kinematic and kinetic motion analysis laboratory measures. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be assessed by accelerometry, coordination in daily life by parent report questionnaire and attitudes to physical activity, self-confidence, anxiety and depressed mood will be assessed by self report questionnaire. A sample of 30 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 5 point difference in motor coordination on the MABC-2 TIS scale (mean 17, sd = 5). DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to examine the impact of new virtual reality games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. The findings will provide critical information to understand whether these electronic games can be used to have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of these children. Given the importance of adequate motor coordination, physical activity and mental health in childhood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of this group of children.

It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. METHODS: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a cybercycle with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them exercisers and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group × time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity. © 2012 Diabetes Technology Society.",,long,long,1,1,1-1,2795,484,1,True,2ee7119e-3a50-53f6-cd0d-cd9771631447,x-x,1024,555,1570980534459,,"{""1008"":0,""21851587"":1,""22920811"":0}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:34:12.400Z""}]",,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da342b6c603e9011b3d6b87,0000749d26--5da342b6c603e9011b3d6b87,3dced0d77636b03eeb1f199c0987e13e,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:28:54.605,2019-10-13T15:34:18.120,2019-10-13T15:34:18.120,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,26.237,,26.237,2,1,False,2,0

26831536,Neck motion kinematics: an inter-tester reliability study using an interactive neck VR assessment in asymptomatic individuals.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. METHODS: This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. RESULTS: Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53����/s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25����/s. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest high reliability for peak and mean velocity as measured by the interactive Neck VR assessment of neck motion kinematics.

15689053,Concomitant use of policosanol and beta-blockers in older patients.,vazquez-2018,0,1.0,,"Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. It is safe and well tolerated, even in populations with high consumption of concomitant drugs. These data suggest that adverse events (AE) due to drug-to-drug interactions (DDI) with policosanol are not relevant. Experimental data indicate that potential DDI between policosanol and drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 hepatic system are not expected, but pharmacodynamic DDI cannot be excluded. Several clinical studies have shown that policosanol decreased arterial pressure compared with placebo, and a pharmacological interaction with beta-blockers was experimentally proven. Therefore, clinical DDI between policosanol and beta-blockers can be expected. This study investigated whether policosanol reinforces the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers and/or whether this combination impairs some safety indicators or induces specific AE in older patients. After 5 weeks on a diet-only baseline period, 205 older hypercholesterolemic patients taking beta-blockers were randomized to policosanol 5 mg/day or placebo for 3 years. After 1 year on therapy, policosanol significantly reduced (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (20.9%), total cholesterol (TC) (19.3%) and triglycerides (TG) (25.7%), whereas it increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus placebo) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (4.1%). Treatment effects did not to wear off during the 3-year follow-up. At study completion, policosanol lowered (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) LDL-C (34.3%), TC (23.2%) and TG (21.2%) and raised (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) HDL-C (12.3%). Thirty-one patients (15.1%) discontinued the study, 22 in the placebo group (20.6%) and nine in the policosanol group (9.2%). Of these, 20 patients (16 in the placebo group and four in the policosanol group) withdrew from the study due to AE. The frequency of serious adverse events (SAE), mostly vascular, in policosanol patients (3/98, 3.1%) was lower than in the placebo group (15/107, 14.0%). No impairment of safety indicators was observed. Nevertheless, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in policosanol patients compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of policosanol patients reporting mild or moderate AE (18/98, 18.4%) was also lower than in the placebo group (30/107, 28.0%). In conclusion, policosanol was well tolerated in elderly patients taking beta-block- ers and did not increase AE. Additional reduction of blood pressure and a lower frequency of SAE were observed in policosanol patients compared with those taking placebo. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of policosanol was that expected. These results provide support that policosanol therapy added to hypercholesterolemic elderly individuals taking beta-blockers could provide additional benefits in lowering blood pressure; SAE were not more frequent in the policosanol group than in the placebo group and there was no increase in AE.",,long,long,0,0,0-0,3041,543,1,False,851af4f6-c90f-1d1b-9682-8d67aaecc425,0-0,360,451,1570980712709,,"{""1009"":6,""15689053"":2,""26831536"":10}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:36:29.908Z""}]",,,3.0,,0-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da343678d24c8010d0bb42c,0000749d26--5da343678d24c8010d0bb42c,617b2a3a0da5a1cf9c7ec69dab37de86,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:31:51.208,2019-10-13T15:36:31.790,2019-10-13T15:36:31.790,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,41.105,,41.105,5,0,True,6,2
26604719,Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. METHODS: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend).

30227884,The effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control in healthy adults: a randomized preliminary study.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Adults with sedentary lifestyles seem to face a higher risk of falling in their later years. Several causes, such as impairment of strength, coordination, and cognitive function, influence worsening health conditions, including balancing ability. Many modalities can be applied to improve the balance function and prevent falling. Several studies have also recorded the effects of balance training in elderly adults for fall prevention. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to define the effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control abilities in healthy adults. METHODS: For this study, ten subjects were randomly allocated into either the conventional exercise (CON) or the virtual reality (VR) group. The CON group underwent physical balance training, while the VR group used the virtual reality system 4 weeks. In the VR group, the scores from three game modes were utilized to describe the effect of motor learning and define the learning curves that were derived with the power law function. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was performed to analyze the postural control in five standing tasks, and data were collected with the help of a force plate. RESULTS: The average score was used to describe the effect of motor learning by deriving the mathematical models for determining the learning curve. Additionally, the models were classified into two exponential functions that relied on the aim and requirement skills. A negative exponential function was observed in the game mode, which requires the cognitive-motor function. In contrast, a positive exponential function was found in the game with use of only the motor skill. Moreover, this curve and its model were also used to describe the effect of learning in the long term and the ratio of difficulty in each game. In the balance performance, there was a significant decrease in the center of pressure parameters in the VR group, while in the CON group, there was a significant increase in the parameters during some foot placements, especially in the medio-lateral direction. CONCLUSION: The proposed VR-based training relies on the effect of motor learning in long-term training though different kinds of task training. In postural analysis, both exercise programs are emphasized to improve the balance ability in healthy adults. However, the virtual reality system can promote better outcomes to improve postural control post exercising. Trial registration Retrospectively registered on 25 April 2018.

Is transfer at odds with task specific training?,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: Transfer of motor skills is the ultimate goal of motor training in rehabilitation practice. In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. METHOD: One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6-10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. RESULTS: ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children.

1046,Influence of UI Complexity and Positioning on User Experience During VR Exergames,scholar,1,1.0,,"In past years, as virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast developing fields in VR are exergames, a combination of physical exercise and game. With a goal to engage people in physical activity, VR exergames should look and feel good for users. Therefore, user interface (UI) in VR is important and has to be built in a way to enhance user experience. In this paper, ergometer is used together with VR rowing environment as VR exergame for a study aiming to explore possibilities of UI in VR. Accordingly, different metrics commonly used to quantify rowing action (e.g, speed and distance) were visualized. The visualizations that were created had different positioning (closer or further away from the player) and different level of complexity (more or less metrics shown as only numbers or in a gamified design). Participants (N = 27) during experiment for this study rowed four times in different conditions depending were metrics of the game were shown: 1) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with gamified visualization of metrics; 2) as a coach boat that follows the player with gamified visualization of metrics on a screen; 3) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with digital visualization of metrics; 4) as a coach boat that follows the player with digital visualization of metrics on a screen.

21851587,"Rationale, design and methods for a randomised and controlled trial of the impact of virtual reality games on motor competence, physical activity, and mental health in children with developmental coordination disorder.",molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: A healthy start to life requires adequate motor development and physical activity participation. Currently 5-15% of children have impaired motor development without any obvious disorder. These children are at greater risk of obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, low social confidence and poor mental health. Traditional electronic game use may impact on motor development and physical activity creating a vicious cycle. However new virtual reality (VR) game interfaces may provide motor experiences that enhance motor development and lead to an increase in motor coordination and better physical activity and mental health outcomes. VR games are beginning to be used for rehabilitation, however there is no reported trial of the impact of these games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. METHODS: This cross-over randomised and controlled trial will examine whether motor coordination is enhanced by access to active electronic games and whether daily activity, attitudes to physical activity and mental health are also enhanced. Thirty children aged 10-12 years with poor motor coordination (��� 15th percentile) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of 'no active electronic games' and 'active electronic games'. Each child will participate in both conditions for 16 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is motor coordination, assessed by kinematic and kinetic motion analysis laboratory measures. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be assessed by accelerometry, coordination in daily life by parent report questionnaire and attitudes to physical activity, self-confidence, anxiety and depressed mood will be assessed by self report questionnaire. A sample of 30 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 5 point difference in motor coordination on the MABC-2 TIS scale (mean 17, sd = 5). DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to examine the impact of new virtual reality games on motor coordination in children with developmental coordination disorder. The findings will provide critical information to understand whether these electronic games can be used to have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of these children. Given the importance of adequate motor coordination, physical activity and mental health in childhood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of this group of children.

It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. METHODS: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a cybercycle with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them exercisers and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group × time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity. © 2012 Diabetes Technology Society.",,long,long,1,1,1-1,2795,484,1,True,71245c75-eb43-9f71-3d50-d5c0459fbaaf,1-1,1536,642,1570981891344,,"{""1046"":59,""21851587"":51,""22920811"":126}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:55:36.943Z""}]",,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da34801c603e9011b3dcee9,0000749d26--5da34801c603e9011b3dcee9,ccc028382951c0895b3d807775cb18d4,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:51:29.224,2019-10-13T15:55:44.327,2019-10-13T15:55:44.327,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,122.059,,122.059,1,1,True,6,126

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nineteen 4th graders played a mixed reality game that included both digital components (projected graphics on the floor) and tangible, physical components (hand-held motion-tracking wands). Players made food choices and experienced immediate feedback on how each item affected the Alien avatar's alertness/health state. One member of the playing dyad had to run short distances to make the game work. The final level included a digital projection of the MyPlate icon, and each food item filled the appropriate quadrant dynamically. RESULTS: All students remained engaged with the game after approximately 1 hour of play. Significant learning gains were seen on a pretest and posttest that assessed nutrition knowledge (paired t18=4.13, P<0.001). In addition, significant learning gains were also seen in knowledge regarding MyPlate (paired t18=3.29, P<0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest preliminary feasibility via demonstrated acceptability and improved within-group content knowledge. Future research should explore improved measures of knowledge gains, alternative mechanisms for supporting the game mechanics to increase the scalability of the system (i.e., via Kinect(®) [Microsoft(®), Redmond, WA] sensors), and the formal evaluation of the system via a randomized controlled trial.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,1761,237,1,True,71245c75-eb43-9f71-3d50-d5c0459fbaaf,x-x,1536,642,1570982147356,,"{""1011"":260,""23501585"":80,""28264717"":109}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T15:58:32.669Z""}]",,,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da349019a4ea1011a6fa0ea,0000749d26--5da349019a4ea1011a6fa0ea,ccc028382951c0895b3d807775cb18d4,APPROVED,2019-10-13T15:55:45.267,2019-10-13T16:04:02.641,2019-10-13T16:04:02.641,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,165.313,,165.313,2,1,False,6,260

The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of older individuals with an intellectual disability with at least one prescription error and (2) to identify potential risk factors for these prescription errors (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frailty index, level of intellectual disability and living situation). The study population consisted of 600 older (≥ 50 years) individuals with an ID using one or more drugs who were randomly selected from the study cohort of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) Study. The medication used at the time of measurement was screened for errors by a hospital pharmacist/clinical pharmacologist and a Master's student pharmacy using consensus methodology. Participants with one or more prescription errors were compared to participants without prescription errors by multivariate logistic regression to identify potential risk factors. The prevalence of individuals with one or more prescription errors was 47.5% (285 of 600 individuals; 95% confidence interval (CI) 43-52%). Relevant errors, defined as errors that actually do require a change of pharmacotherapy, were identified in 26.8% of the individuals (161 of 600 individuals; 95% CI 23-30%).

28264717,Mobile Exergaming for Health-Effects of a serious game application for smartphones on physical activity and exercise adherence in type 2 diabetes mellitus-study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Exergaming is a novel approach to increase motivation for regular physical activity (PA) among sedentary individuals such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because existing exergames do not offer fitness-level adjusted, individualized workouts and are normally stationary (TV bound), thus not enabling PA anywhere and at any time, we developed a smartphone-based, game-like software application (MOBIGAME) specifically designed for middle-aged T2DM patients to induce a healthier, more active lifestyle as part of successful T2DM treatment and management. In a randomized controlled trial we aim to examine whether our smartphone-based game application can lead to increases in daily PA in T2DM patients that are persistent in the mid to long term and whether these increases are greater than those in a control group. METHODS: This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 42 T2DM patients [45-70 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, low daily PA, regular smartphone use]. The experimental intervention (duration 24 weeks) includes individualized multidimensional home-based exercise and daily PA promotion administered through MOBIGAME. The control intervention consists of a one-time standard lifestyle counseling including the promotion of baseline activities. The primary outcome is daily PA measured as steps per day. Secondary outcome is exercise adherence measured via the usage data from the participants' smartphones (experimental intervention) and as self-recorded exercise log entries (control intervention). We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control group with respect to post-interventional daily PA (as well as all other outcomes) using analysis of covariance. For each analysis, an estimate (with 95% confidence interval) of the difference in outcome between both groups will be reported. DISCUSSION: This research will investigate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based, game-like software application to be used as a way to promote regular daily PA among inactive T2DM patients. The results of this trial may have important implications for future PA-promoting interventions and provide relevant information for the general transferability of such applications to be used as part of the treatment in other chronic diseases.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of VR-based rehabilitation combined with standard occupational therapy on distal upper extremity function and HRQoL, and compare the findings to those of amount-matched conventional rehabilitation in stroke survivors. METHODS: The present study was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The study included 46 stroke survivors who were randomized to a Smart Glove (SG) group or a conventional intervention (CON) group. In both groups, the interventions were targeted to the distal upper extremity and standard occupational therapy was administered. The primary outcome was the change in the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM) scores, and the secondary outcomes were the changes in the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), Purdue pegboard test, and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores. The outcomes were assessed before the intervention, in the middle of the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1��month after the intervention. RESULTS: The improvements in the FM (FM-total, FM-prox, and FM-dist), JTT (JTT-total and JTT-gross), and SIS (composite and overall SIS, SIS-social participation, and SIS-mobility) scores were significantly greater in the SG group than in the CON group.

METHODS: The system table tilted to adjust arm gravity loading. Participants wore arm supports that sensed grasp strength and wrist position on the table. Wrist weights further increased shoulder exertion. Games were designed to improve UE strength, motor function, cognition and emotive state and adapted automatically to each participant. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 8 weeks in two skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Participants were evaluated pre-therapy and post-therapy using standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach, table tilt and number of arm repetitions were stored on a remote server. OUTCOMES: Seven participants had significant improvements in their active range of shoulder movement, supported arm reach, shoulder strength, grasp strength and their ability to focus. The group demonstrated higher arm function measured with FMA (p���=���0.01) and CAHAI (p���=���0.05), and had an improvement in depression (Becks Depression Inventory, II). BrightArm Duo technology was well accepted by participants with a rating of 4.4 out of 5 points.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and benefits of physical therapy based on a task-oriented approach delivered via an engaging, interactive video game paradigm. The intervention focused on performing targeted dynamic tasks, which included reactive balance controls and environmental interaction. DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in a geriatric day hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty community-dwelling and ambulatory older adults attending the day hospital for treatment of balance and mobility limitations participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS: Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed Up & Go Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures.

26831536,Neck motion kinematics: an inter-tester reliability study using an interactive neck VR assessment in asymptomatic individuals.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. METHODS: This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. RESULTS: Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53����/s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25����/s.

29142090,Virtual Reality Training for Upper Extremity in Subacute Stroke (VIRTUES): A multicenter RCT.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of upper extremity virtual reality rehabilitation training (VR) to time-matched conventional training (CT) in the subacute phase after stroke. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind phase III multicenter trial, 120 participants with upper extremity motor impairment within 12 weeks after stroke were consecutively included at 5 rehabilitation institutions. Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional experiment design was used to analyze muscle activity (surface electromyography), heart rate, perceived exertion (RPE), cybersickness symptoms, perceived workload, and physical activity enjoyment (PACES) in 33 participants performing two 5-minute flights on a new training device. RESULTS: Participants' performance of the planking position required to play the game resulted in moderate aerobic intensity (108 [SD 18.69] bpm). Due to the mainly isometric contraction of the dorsal muscle chain (with a mean activation between 20.6% [SD 10.57] and 26.7% [SD 17.39] maximum voluntary isometric contraction), participants described the exercise as a moderate to vigorous activity (RPE 14.6 [SD 1.82]). The majority reported that they enjoyed the exercise (PACES 3.74 [SD 0.16]). However, six participants had to drop out because of cybersickness symptoms and two because of muscle pain due to prior injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fully immersive VR training systems can contribute to muscle-strengthening activities for healthy users. However, the dropout rate highlights the need for technological improvements in both software and hardware. In prevention and therapy, movement quality is a fundamental part of providing effective resistance training that benefits health. Exergaming on a regular basis has the potential to develop strong muscles and a healthy back. It is essential that future VR-based training systems take into account the recommendations of sport and exercise science. ©Boris Feodoroff, Ippokratis Konstantinidis, Ingo Froböse.

1011,Alien Health Game: An Embodied Exergame to Instruct in Nutrition and MyPlate,pubmed,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: A feasibility study was run on an immersive, embodied exergame (Alien Health Game) designed to teach 4th-12th-grade students about nutrition and several U.S. Department of Agriculture MyPlate guidelines. This study assessed acceptability and limited efficacy. Students learned about the amount of nutrients and optimizers in common food items and practiced making rapid food choices while engaging in short cardiovascular activities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nineteen 4th graders played a mixed reality game that included both digital components (projected graphics on the floor) and tangible, physical components (hand-held motion-tracking wands). Players made food choices and experienced immediate feedback on how each item affected the Alien avatar's alertness/health state. One member of the playing dyad had to run short distances to make the game work. The final level included a digital projection of the MyPlate icon, and each food item filled the appropriate quadrant dynamically. RESULTS: All students remained engaged with the game after approximately 1 hour of play. Significant learning gains were seen on a pretest and posttest that assessed nutrition knowledge (paired t18=4.13, P<0.001). In addition, significant learning gains were also seen in knowledge regarding MyPlate (paired t18=3.29, P<0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest preliminary feasibility via demonstrated acceptability and improved within-group content knowledge. Future research should explore improved measures of knowledge gains, alternative mechanisms for supporting the game mechanics to increase the scalability of the system (i.e., via Kinect(®) [Microsoft(®), Redmond, WA] sensors), and the formal evaluation of the system via a randomized controlled trial.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,1761,237,1,True,dc5bdbac-a256-dfbe-2cdb-50e9415ccce4,1-1,1326,546,1570983079206,,"{""1011"":64,""23501585"":22,""31464194"":1}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:12:46.175Z""},{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:12:59.232Z""}]",,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da34ca75d4a2c01208e0ab1,0000749d26--5da34ca75d4a2c01208e0ab1,8e7c2022ad7dbec42c75842df9467c91,APPROVED,2019-10-13T16:11:19.409,2019-10-13T16:13:26.681,2019-10-13T16:13:26.681,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,79.259,,79.259,1,1,True,2,64

The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of older individuals with an intellectual disability with at least one prescription error and (2) to identify potential risk factors for these prescription errors (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frailty index, level of intellectual disability and living situation). The study population consisted of 600 older (≥ 50 years) individuals with an ID using one or more drugs who were randomly selected from the study cohort of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) Study. The medication used at the time of measurement was screened for errors by a hospital pharmacist/clinical pharmacologist and a Master's student pharmacy using consensus methodology. Participants with one or more prescription errors were compared to participants without prescription errors by multivariate logistic regression to identify potential risk factors. The prevalence of individuals with one or more prescription errors was 47.5% (285 of 600 individuals; 95% confidence interval (CI) 43-52%). Relevant errors, defined as errors that actually do require a change of pharmacotherapy, were identified in 26.8% of the individuals (161 of 600 individuals; 95% CI 23-30%).

26218427,Integrative rehabilitation of residents chronic post-stroke in skilled nursing facilities: the design and evaluation of the BrightArm Duo.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"PURPOSE: To describe the novel BrightArm Duo bimanual upper extremity (UE) rehabilitation system; to determine its technology acceptance and clinical benefit for older hemiplegic participants. METHODS: The system table tilted to adjust arm gravity loading. Participants wore arm supports that sensed grasp strength and wrist position on the table. Wrist weights further increased shoulder exertion. Games were designed to improve UE strength, motor function, cognition and emotive state and adapted automatically to each participant. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 8 weeks in two skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Participants were evaluated pre-therapy and post-therapy using standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach, table tilt and number of arm repetitions were stored on a remote server. OUTCOMES: Seven participants had significant improvements in their active range of shoulder movement, supported arm reach, shoulder strength, grasp strength and their ability to focus. The group demonstrated higher arm function measured with FMA (p���=���0.01) and CAHAI (p���=���0.05), and had an improvement in depression (Becks Depression Inventory, II). BrightArm Duo technology was well accepted by participants with a rating of 4.4 out of 5 points. CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, it will be beneficial to evaluate the BrightArm Duo application in SNF maintenance programs. Implications for Rehabilitation Integrative rehabilitation that addresses both physical and cognitive domains is promising for post-stroke maintenance in skilled nursing facilities.

Motor-learning interventions are hypothesized to ameliorate motor and cognitive deficits in older adults. Especially, video game-based physical exercise might have the potential to train motor in combination with cognitive abilities in older adults. The aim of this study was to compare conventional balance training with video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, on the relative power (RP) of electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies over the PFC, executive function (EF), and gait performance. Twenty-seven participants (mean age 79.2 ± 7.3 years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. All participants completed 24 trainings including three times a 30 min session/week. The EEG measurements showed that theta RP significantly decreased in favor of the exergame group [L(14) = 6.23, p = 0.007]. Comparing pre- vs. post-test, EFs improved both within the exergame (working memory: z = -2.28, p = 0.021; divided attention auditory: z = -2.51, p = 0.009; divided attention visual: z = -2.06, p = 0.040; go/no-go: z = -2.55, p = 0.008; set-shifting: z = -2.90, p = 0.002) and within the balance group (set-shifting: z = -2.04, p = 0.042).

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of VR-based rehabilitation combined with standard occupational therapy on distal upper extremity function and HRQoL, and compare the findings to those of amount-matched conventional rehabilitation in stroke survivors. METHODS: The present study was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The study included 46 stroke survivors who were randomized to a Smart Glove (SG) group or a conventional intervention (CON) group. In both groups, the interventions were targeted to the distal upper extremity and standard occupational therapy was administered. The primary outcome was the change in the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM) scores, and the secondary outcomes were the changes in the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), Purdue pegboard test, and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores. The outcomes were assessed before the intervention, in the middle of the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1��month after the intervention. RESULTS: The improvements in the FM (FM-total, FM-prox, and FM-dist), JTT (JTT-total and JTT-gross), and SIS (composite and overall SIS, SIS-social participation, and SIS-mobility) scores were significantly greater in the SG group than in the CON group.

With this in mind, this paper presents Motion Rehab AVE 3D, a serious game for post-stroke rehabilitation of patients with mild stroke. The aim is offer a new technology in order to assist the traditional therapy and motivate the patient to execute his/her rehabilitation program, under health professional supervision. METHODS: The game was developed with Unity game engine, supporting Kinect motion sensing input device and display devices like Smart TV 3D and Oculus Rift. It contemplates six activities considering exercises in a tridimensional space: flexion, abduction, shoulder adduction, horizontal shoulder adduction and abduction, elbow extension, wrist extension, knee flexion, and hip flexion and abduction. Motion Rehab AVE 3D also report about hits and errors to the physiotherapist evaluate the patient's progress. RESULTS: A pilot study with 10 healthy participants (61-75 years old) tested one of the game levels. They experienced the 3D user interface in third-person. Our initial goal was to map a basic and comfortable setup of equipment in order to adopt later. All the participants (100%) classified the interaction process as interesting and amazing for the age, presenting a good acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation showed that the game could be used as a useful tool to motivate the patients during rehabilitation sessions. Next step is to evaluate its effectiveness for stroke patients, in order to verify if the interface and game exercises contribute into the motor rehabilitation treatment progress.

30227884,The effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control in healthy adults: a randomized preliminary study.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Adults with sedentary lifestyles seem to face a higher risk of falling in their later years. Several causes, such as impairment of strength, coordination, and cognitive function, influence worsening health conditions, including balancing ability. Many modalities can be applied to improve the balance function and prevent falling. Several studies have also recorded the effects of balance training in elderly adults for fall prevention. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to define the effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control abilities in healthy adults. METHODS: For this study, ten subjects were randomly allocated into either the conventional exercise (CON) or the virtual reality (VR) group. The CON group underwent physical balance training, while the VR group used the virtual reality system 4 weeks. In the VR group, the scores from three game modes were utilized to describe the effect of motor learning and define the learning curves that were derived with the power law function. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was performed to analyze the postural control in five standing tasks, and data were collected with the help of a force plate. RESULTS: The average score was used to describe the effect of motor learning by deriving the mathematical models for determining the learning curve. Additionally, the models were classified into two exponential functions that relied on the aim and requirement skills. A negative exponential function was observed in the game mode, which requires the cognitive-motor function. In contrast, a positive exponential function was found in the game with use of only the motor skill. Moreover, this curve and its model were also used to describe the effect of learning in the long term and the ratio of difficulty in each game. In the balance performance, there was a significant decrease in the center of pressure parameters in the VR group, while in the CON group, there was a significant increase in the parameters during some foot placements, especially in the medio-lateral direction. CONCLUSION: The proposed VR-based training relies on the effect of motor learning in long-term training though different kinds of task training. In postural analysis, both exercise programs are emphasized to improve the balance ability in healthy adults. However, the virtual reality system can promote better outcomes to improve postural control post exercising. Trial registration Retrospectively registered on 25 April 2018.

26604719,Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. METHODS: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001).

1008,3-D streaming supplying partner protocols for mobile collaborative exergaming for health,pubmed,1,1.0,,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data.

METHODS: The validation started with an explanation of the goals, content, and features of the simulator (content validity). Then, participants from eight different medical centers consisting of experts (> or =100 laparoscopic procedures performed) and surgical trainees (<100) were informed of the goals and received a hands-on tour of the virtual reality (VR) trainer. Subsequently, they were asked to answer 28 structured questions about the simulator (face validity). Ratings were scored on a scale from 1 (very bad/useless) to 5 (excellent/very useful). Additional comments could be given as well. Furthermore, two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, aimed at establishing concurrent validity, the training effect of a single-handed hand-eye coordination task in the simulator was compared with a similar task in a conventional box trainer and with the performance of a control group that received no training. In experiment 2 (first step of construct validity), the total score of task time, collisions, and path length of three consecutive runs in the simulator was compared between experts (>100 endoscopic procedures) and novices (no experience). RESULTS: A total of 75 participants (36 expert surgeons and 39 surgical trainees) filled out the questionnaire. Usefulness of tasks, features, and movement realism were scored between a mean value of 3.3 for depth perception and 4.3 for appreciation of training with the instrument. There were no significant differences between the mean values of the scores given by the experts and surgical trainees. In response to statements, 81% considered this VR trainer generally useful for training endoscopic techniques to residents, and 83% agreed that the simulator was useful to train hand-eye coordination. In experiment 1, the training effect for the single-handed task showed no significant difference between the conventional trainer and the VR simulator (concurrent validity). In experiment 2, experts scored significantly better than novices on all parameters used (construct validity). CONCLUSION: Content, face, and concurrent validity of the SIMENDO is established.

29183035,User-Oriented Evaluation of a Robotic Rollator That Provides Navigation Assistance in Frail Older Adults with and without Cognitive Impairment.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Navigational skills decline with age, and this decline is even more pronounced in cognitively impaired (CI) older adults. Navigation assistance is an emerging functionality of robotic rollators (RRs). The evidence on the effectiveness of RR-integrated navigation systems in potential end-users is, however, scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether RR-provided navigation assistance improves navigation within a real-life environment in the intended user group of frail older adults with and without cognitive impairment currently using a rollator in daily life. METHODS: A randomized, between-subject, 2 × 2 factorial design was conducted to test the effects of navigation assistance and cognitive status on participants' navigation performance. Twenty CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 17-26) and 22 not cognitively impaired (NCI; MMSE >26) older rollator users (age 82.5 ± 8.7 years) were included. Participants were matched for cognitive status (CI vs. NCI) and randomized to one of two conditions: RR (1) with or (2) without activated navigation system. All participants had to complete a two-section navigation path with the RR in an unfamiliar, real-life environment. Participants with RR-assisted navigation were supported in wayfinding by directional audio cues of the RR-integrated navigation system. Participants without RR-assisted navigation had to complete the sections by orienting themselves along conventional signposts. Outcomes were success rate, completion and stopping time, number of stops, walking distance, and gait speed. RESULTS: The navigation assistance condition had no significant effect on the success rate in the CI, NCI, or total group. We found significant interactions between navigation assistance and cognitive status for both sections (p = 0.002-0.040), such that RR-assisted navigation reduced the completion time (both sections), stopping time (section 1), and number of stops (section 2) in the CI (p ≤ 0.001-0.014) but not in the NCI group. On the more complex section 2, RR-assisted navigation led to a reduced stopping time and walking distance in the total group (p = 0.014-0.016). CONCLUSION: The RR-integrated navigation system was effective for improving navigation within a real-life environment in potential end-users, especially in those with cognitive impairment. This is the first study to provide statistical evidence on the effectiveness of an RR-integrated navigation system in the intended user group. © 2017 S.

26831536,Neck motion kinematics: an inter-tester reliability study using an interactive neck VR assessment in asymptomatic individuals.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. METHODS: This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. RESULTS: Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53����/s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25����/s.

OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness depends on adherence, so did patients use the intervention to the recommended level? If not, what reasons did they give? The purpose of this study was to investigate these and related questions. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, plus qualitative analysis of interviews, was conducted. METHODS: Seventeen patients recovering from stroke recruited to the intervention arm of a feasibility trial had the equipment left in their homes for 8 weeks and were advised to use it 3 times a day for periods of no more than 20 minutes. Frequency and duration of use were automatically recorded. At the end of the intervention, participants were interviewed to determine barriers to using it in the recommended way. RESULTS: Duration of use and how many days they used the equipment are presented for the 13 participants who successfully started the intervention. These figures were highly variable and could fall far short of our recommendations. There was a weak positive correlation between duration and baseline reported activities of daily living. Participants reported lack of familiarity with technology and competing commitments as barriers to use, although they appreciated the flexibility of the intervention and found it motivating. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Level of use is variable and can fall far short of recommendations.

Several studies have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ (NWFP) interactive video games, and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and (5) fear of falling (FES-I).

26604719,Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. METHODS: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend).

30227884,The effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control in healthy adults: a randomized preliminary study.,kelly-2018,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Adults with sedentary lifestyles seem to face a higher risk of falling in their later years. Several causes, such as impairment of strength, coordination, and cognitive function, influence worsening health conditions, including balancing ability. Many modalities can be applied to improve the balance function and prevent falling. Several studies have also recorded the effects of balance training in elderly adults for fall prevention. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to define the effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control abilities in healthy adults. METHODS: For this study, ten subjects were randomly allocated into either the conventional exercise (CON) or the virtual reality (VR) group. The CON group underwent physical balance training, while the VR group used the virtual reality system 4 weeks. In the VR group, the scores from three game modes were utilized to describe the effect of motor learning and define the learning curves that were derived with the power law function. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was performed to analyze the postural control in five standing tasks, and data were collected with the help of a force plate. RESULTS: The average score was used to describe the effect of motor learning by deriving the mathematical models for determining the learning curve. Additionally, the models were classified into two exponential functions that relied on the aim and requirement skills. A negative exponential function was observed in the game mode, which requires the cognitive-motor function. In contrast, a positive exponential function was found in the game with use of only the motor skill. Moreover, this curve and its model were also used to describe the effect of learning in the long term and the ratio of difficulty in each game. In the balance performance, there was a significant decrease in the center of pressure parameters in the VR group, while in the CON group, there was a significant increase in the parameters during some foot placements, especially in the medio-lateral direction. CONCLUSION: The proposed VR-based training relies on the effect of motor learning in long-term training though different kinds of task training. In postural analysis, both exercise programs are emphasized to improve the balance ability in healthy adults. However, the virtual reality system can promote better outcomes to improve postural control post exercising. Trial registration Retrospectively registered on 25 April 2018.

16437275,Validation of a new basic virtual reality simulator for training of basic endoscopic skills: the SIMENDO.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to establish content, face, concurrent, and the first step of construct validity of a new simulator, the SIMENDO, in order to determine its usefulness for training basic endoscopic skills. METHODS: The validation started with an explanation of the goals, content, and features of the simulator (content validity). Then, participants from eight different medical centers consisting of experts (> or =100 laparoscopic procedures performed) and surgical trainees (<100) were informed of the goals and received a hands-on tour of the virtual reality (VR) trainer. Subsequently, they were asked to answer 28 structured questions about the simulator (face validity). Ratings were scored on a scale from 1 (very bad/useless) to 5 (excellent/very useful). Additional comments could be given as well. Furthermore, two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, aimed at establishing concurrent validity, the training effect of a single-handed hand-eye coordination task in the simulator was compared with a similar task in a conventional box trainer and with the performance of a control group that received no training. In experiment 2 (first step of construct validity), the total score of task time, collisions, and path length of three consecutive runs in the simulator was compared between experts (>100 endoscopic procedures) and novices (no experience). RESULTS: A total of 75 participants (36 expert surgeons and 39 surgical trainees) filled out the questionnaire. Usefulness of tasks, features, and movement realism were scored between a mean value of 3.3 for depth perception and 4.3 for appreciation of training with the instrument. There were no significant differences between the mean values of the scores given by the experts and surgical trainees. In response to statements, 81% considered this VR trainer generally useful for training endoscopic techniques to residents, and 83% agreed that the simulator was useful to train hand-eye coordination. In experiment 1, the training effect for the single-handed task showed no significant difference between the conventional trainer and the VR simulator (concurrent validity). In experiment 2, experts scored significantly better than novices on all parameters used (construct validity). CONCLUSION: Content, face, and concurrent validity of the SIMENDO is established. The simulator is considered useful for training eye-hand coordination for endoscopic surgery. The evaluated task could discriminate between the skills of experienced surgeons and novices, giving the first indication of construct validity.",,long,short,0,0,0-0,2603,461,1,True,079dc169-cfad-e933-8d34-9d269a9a2c4a,x-x,1366,577,1570984186391,,"{""1003"":35,""16437275"":53,""29183035"":50}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:30:52.246Z""}]",,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da350f3c9709e011efdb3f2,0000749d26--5da350f3c9709e011efdb3f2,a648f219b132c66f866f71961bc242d9,APPROVED,2019-10-13T16:29:39.196,2019-10-13T16:32:22.049,2019-10-13T16:32:22.049,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,65.855,,65.855,3,0,False,6,53
1003,Effects of substituting a portion of standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors,howard-2017,1,1.0,,"Background. Evidence indicates that the continuation of therapy among community-dwelling stroke survivors improves physical function. Community rehabilitation programmes often face limitations in terms of resources. It is imperative to include new motivational interventions to encourage some level of non-clinician management. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any changes in physical function and activities of daily living when substituting a portion of the standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors. Methods. In this controlled trial, the experimental group received 30 minutes of virtual reality balance games in addition to 90 minutes of standard physiotherapy. The control group continued with their two hours of routine standard physiotherapy. Both groups received 12 therapy sessions: two-hour sessions twice per week for six continuous weeks. Changes in physical function, activities of daily living and balance ability were assessed using the Timed Up and Go test, 30-second Sit to Stand test, Timed Ten-Metre Walk test, Six-Minute Walk test and the Barthel Index, and static balance was assessed using a probalance board. Results. Twenty-eight participants completed post-intervention assessments. The results showed a significant within-subject effect on the Timed Up and Go test: F (1, 26) = 5.83, p = 0.02; and the 30-second Sit to Stand test; F (1, 26) = 13.50, p = 0.001. The between-subject effect was not significant (p > 0.05) for any of the outcome measurements. Conclusion. Substituting a portion of the standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games was equally effective in maintaining physical function outcomes and activities of daily living among community-dwelling stroke survivors.

29183035,User-Oriented Evaluation of a Robotic Rollator That Provides Navigation Assistance in Frail Older Adults with and without Cognitive Impairment.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Navigational skills decline with age, and this decline is even more pronounced in cognitively impaired (CI) older adults. Navigation assistance is an emerging functionality of robotic rollators (RRs). The evidence on the effectiveness of RR-integrated navigation systems in potential end-users is, however, scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether RR-provided navigation assistance improves navigation within a real-life environment in the intended user group of frail older adults with and without cognitive impairment currently using a rollator in daily life. METHODS: A randomized, between-subject, 2 × 2 factorial design was conducted to test the effects of navigation assistance and cognitive status on participants' navigation performance. Twenty CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 17-26) and 22 not cognitively impaired (NCI; MMSE >26) older rollator users (age 82.5 ± 8.7 years) were included. Participants were matched for cognitive status (CI vs. NCI) and randomized to one of two conditions: RR (1) with or (2) without activated navigation system. All participants had to complete a two-section navigation path with the RR in an unfamiliar, real-life environment. Participants with RR-assisted navigation were supported in wayfinding by directional audio cues of the RR-integrated navigation system. Participants without RR-assisted navigation had to complete the sections by orienting themselves along conventional signposts. Outcomes were success rate, completion and stopping time, number of stops, walking distance, and gait speed. RESULTS: The navigation assistance condition had no significant effect on the success rate in the CI, NCI, or total group. We found significant interactions between navigation assistance and cognitive status for both sections (p = 0.002-0.040), such that RR-assisted navigation reduced the completion time (both sections), stopping time (section 1), and number of stops (section 2) in the CI (p ≤ 0.001-0.014) but not in the NCI group. On the more complex section 2, RR-assisted navigation led to a reduced stopping time and walking distance in the total group (p = 0.014-0.016). CONCLUSION: The RR-integrated navigation system was effective for improving navigation within a real-life environment in potential end-users, especially in those with cognitive impairment. This is the first study to provide statistical evidence on the effectiveness of an RR-integrated navigation system in the intended user group. © 2017 S.

31464194,Effects of Full Body Exergaming in Virtual Reality on Cardiovascular and Muscular Parameters: Cross-Sectional Experiment,pubmed,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, many studies have associated sedentary behavior in front of screens with health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Yet options for exergaming-playing video games that require rigorous physical exercise-seem to fall short of the physical activity levels recommended by the World Health Organization. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a fully immersive virtual reality (VR)-based training system on cardiovascular and muscular parameters of young adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional experiment design was used to analyze muscle activity (surface electromyography), heart rate, perceived exertion (RPE), cybersickness symptoms, perceived workload, and physical activity enjoyment (PACES) in 33 participants performing two 5-minute flights on a new training device. RESULTS: Participants' performance of the planking position required to play the game resulted in moderate aerobic intensity (108 [SD 18.69] bpm). Due to the mainly isometric contraction of the dorsal muscle chain (with a mean activation between 20.6% [SD 10.57] and 26.7% [SD 17.39] maximum voluntary isometric contraction), participants described the exercise as a moderate to vigorous activity (RPE 14.6 [SD 1.82]). The majority reported that they enjoyed the exercise (PACES 3.74 [SD 0.16]). However, six participants had to drop out because of cybersickness symptoms and two because of muscle pain due to prior injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fully immersive VR training systems can contribute to muscle-strengthening activities for healthy users. However, the dropout rate highlights the need for technological improvements in both software and hardware. In prevention and therapy, movement quality is a fundamental part of providing effective resistance training that benefits health. Exergaming on a regular basis has the potential to develop strong muscles and a healthy back. It is essential that future VR-based training systems take into account the recommendations of sport and exercise science. ©Boris Feodoroff, Ippokratis Konstantinidis, Ingo Froböse.

27965570,Combining Exergame Training with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Effect on Neuronal Structure/Function in the Elderly Brain.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

The Nintendo Wii potentially offers a fun, convenient way of overcoming some of these. The aim was to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Mii-vitaliSe; a home-based, physiotherapist-supported Nintendo Wii intervention. DESIGN: A single-centre wait-list randomised controlled study. SETTING: MS service in secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory, relatively inactive people with clinically confirmed MS. INTERVENTION: Thirty participants were randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe either immediately (for 12 months) or after a 6-month wait (for 6 months). Mii-vitaliSe consisted of two supervised Nintendo Wii familiarisation sessions in the hospital followed by home use (Wii Sports, Sports Resort and Fit Plus software) with physiotherapist support and personalised resources. OUTCOMES: Included self-reported physical activity levels, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, fatigue and assessments of balance, gait, mobility and hand dexterity at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviews (n=25) explored participants' experiences and, at study end, the two Mii-vitaliSe facilitators' experiences of intervention delivery (main qualitative findings reported separately). RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (8.7) years, 90% female, with 47% diagnosed with MS <6 years ago and 60% new to active gaming. The recruitment rate was 31% (95% CI 20% to 44%). Outcome data were available for 29 (97%) at 6 months and 28 (93%) at 12 months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Qualitative data indicated that Mii-vitaliSe was well-received. Mean Wii use across both groups over the initial 6-month intervention period was twice a week for 27 min/day. Mean cost of delivering Mii-vitaliSe was £684 per person. DISCUSSION: Mii-vitaliSe appears acceptable and a future trial feasible and warranted. These findings will inform its design.

17135805,ADCS Prevention Instrument Project: overview and initial results.,kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"One objective of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) is to develop new or improved instruments and assessment methods for evaluating treatment efficacy in Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical trials. The ADCS Instrument Committee has previously helped to define the state of the art in assessment for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment clinical trials. We are now entering an exciting era of primary prevention trials to evaluate promising treatments that may delay disease onset and there is a need to develop appropriate instruments for these trials. The ADCS instrument committee has undertaken a project to develop instruments for prevention studies that assess domains known to be important in AD. Prevention trials are long and require large numbers of subjects, making them costly and requiring a high burden of participation for subjects. The current study focused on developing instruments that can be completed at home and in the clinic. The instruments are being evaluated in a cohort of nondemented elderly participating in a 4-year longitudinal study that simulates the design of a primary prevention trial. This report describes the design, baseline characteristics, and some longitudinal outcomes of the study cohort through the completion of the first 2 years of follow-up. We also describe the assessment domains to be measured with our new experimental instruments. This study recruited 644 subjects, 75 years of age and older. Participation in a book club that provided free books of interest to elders was offered as a recruitment incentive. Approximately 23% had some mild cognitive symptoms consistent with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5. All subjects received a standardized in-clinic evaluation at baseline, which is repeated annually for 4 years to identify cases suspected of developing dementia and to measure longitudinal change on established clinical assessments. Subjects completed a set of self-administered experimental instruments at home or in the clinic designed to assess cognitive function and behavior, global change, activities of daily living, quality of life, and resource use. An additional mail-in cognitive function questionnaire was obtained separately by mail, 1 month before the other assessments. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and validity of the home-based instruments in comparison with acquiring the same information during a clinic visit, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions in which the baseline and annual follow-up assessments are completed either at home (home group) or at the study site during their clinic visits (clinic group).

21474638,Effects of virtual reality-augmented balance training on sensory organization and attentional demand for postural control in people with Parkinson disease: a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies related to virtual reality (VR)-augmented balance training on postural control in people with Parkinson disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were: (1) to examine the effects of VR-augmented balance training on the sensory integration of postural control under varying attentional demands and (2) to compare the results with those of a conventional balance training (CB) group and an untrained control group. DESIGN: A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial was used. SETTING: The intervention was conducted in the clinic, and the assessment was performed in a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Forty-two people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages II-III) were recruited. INTERVENTION: The VR and CB groups received a 6-week balance training program. MEASUREMENTS: The sensory organization tests (SOTs) of computerized posturography with single- and dual-task conditions were conducted prior to training, after training, and at follow-up. Equilibrium scores, sensory ratios, and verbal reaction times (VRTs) were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in equilibrium scores or VRTs between the VR and CB groups. However, the equilibrium scores in SOT-6 (ie, unreliable vision and somatosensation) of the VR group increased significantly more than that of the control group after training. The equilibrium scores in SOT-5 (ie, unreliable somatosensation with eyes closed) of the CB group also increased significantly more than that of the control group after training.

27317506,Changing Behavioral Lifestyle Risk Factors Related to Cognitive Decline in Later Life Using a Self-Motivated eHealth Intervention in Dutch Adults.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults. METHODS: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage. RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95% CI 0.49-1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components. CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.

31136450,Exergaming-Based Dexterity Training in Persons With Parkinson Disease: A Pilot Feasibility Study.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) suffer from impaired dexterity, which impacts activities of daily living and quality of life. Exergaming, video game-based training with augmented virtual reality, may have value for improving function. The aim of the present pilot study was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of a dexterity training program using exergaming, in individuals with PD. METHODS: Ten participants with PD (aged between 55 and 75 years, Hoehn and Yahr stages II-IV) trained over a period of 4 weeks, twice a week for 30 minutes. Baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments were done. Primary outcomes with respect to feasibility were the adherence rate, open-end questions, the level of participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale), and the usability (System Usability Scale). Dexterous function was measured with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the Dexterity Questionnaire-24. Upper limb motor impairment was assessed by a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Finally, quality of life was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). RESULTS: Adherence rate was 99%, motivation increased significantly from 3.9 to 4.8 (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale, P = 0.03), and system usability of the exergaming system was acceptable to very good. Regarding potential efficacy, participants with impaired dexterity at T0 significantly improved in the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the PDQ-39. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this pilot study suggest that exergaming is feasible and has potential to improve dexterity in individuals with PD. Its efficacy should be investigated in a properly powered randomized controlled trial.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A270).",,long,medium,1,1,1-1,1941,329,1,True,079dc169-cfad-e933-8d34-9d269a9a2c4a,x-x,1366,577,1570984628788,,"{""1046"":27,""30233154"":28,""31136450"":30}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:37:49.187Z""}]",,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da352b12bdcab0121065a49,0000749d26--5da352b12bdcab0121065a49,a648f219b132c66f866f71961bc242d9,APPROVED,2019-10-13T16:37:05.935,2019-10-13T16:38:52.301,2019-10-13T16:38:52.301,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,40.399,,40.399,6,1,False,6,30

Aim: This pilot clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 03069391) examined neuropsychological and neurobiological outcomes of interactive physical and mental exercise. Participants and methods: Older adults (MCI and caregivers) were enrolled in a 3-month, in-home trial of a portable neuro-exergame (the interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System [iPACES���]), in which they pedaled and steered along a virtual bike path to complete a list of errands (Memory Lane���). Neuropsychological function and salivary biomarkers were measured at pre-, mid-, and posttrial. Ten older adults complied with the recommended use of iPACES (complete dose; ���2��/wk, 67% of the 15 who also had pre- and postevaluation data). Statistical analyses compared change over time and also change among those with a complete dose vs inadequate dose. Correlations between change in neuropsychological and biomarker measures were also examined. Results: Executive function and verbal memory increased after 3 months (p = 0.01; no significant change was found with an inadequate dose). Change in salivary biomarkers was moderately associated with increasing cognition (cortisol, r = 0.68; IGF-1, r = 0.37).

1046,Influence of UI Complexity and Positioning on User Experience During VR Exergames,scholar,1,1.0,,"In past years, as virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast developing fields in VR are exergames, a combination of physical exercise and game. With a goal to engage people in physical activity, VR exergames should look and feel good for users. Therefore, user interface (UI) in VR is important and has to be built in a way to enhance user experience. In this paper, ergometer is used together with VR rowing environment as VR exergame for a study aiming to explore possibilities of UI in VR. Accordingly, different metrics commonly used to quantify rowing action (e.g, speed and distance) were visualized. The visualizations that were created had different positioning (closer or further away from the player) and different level of complexity (more or less metrics shown as only numbers or in a gamified design). Participants (N = 27) during experiment for this study rowed four times in different conditions depending were metrics of the game were shown: 1) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with gamified visualization of metrics; 2) as a coach boat that follows the player with gamified visualization of metrics on a screen; 3) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with digital visualization of metrics; 4) as a coach boat that follows the player with digital visualization of metrics on a screen. Results show that level of UI complexity has a significant influence on readability, while positioning of UI elements significantly influences users' perception of support from system.

29183035,User-Oriented Evaluation of a Robotic Rollator That Provides Navigation Assistance in Frail Older Adults with and without Cognitive Impairment.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Navigational skills decline with age, and this decline is even more pronounced in cognitively impaired (CI) older adults. Navigation assistance is an emerging functionality of robotic rollators (RRs). The evidence on the effectiveness of RR-integrated navigation systems in potential end-users is, however, scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether RR-provided navigation assistance improves navigation within a real-life environment in the intended user group of frail older adults with and without cognitive impairment currently using a rollator in daily life. METHODS: A randomized, between-subject, 2 × 2 factorial design was conducted to test the effects of navigation assistance and cognitive status on participants' navigation performance. Twenty CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 17-26) and 22 not cognitively impaired (NCI; MMSE >26) older rollator users (age 82.5 ± 8.7 years) were included. Participants were matched for cognitive status (CI vs. NCI) and randomized to one of two conditions: RR (1) with or (2) without activated navigation system. All participants had to complete a two-section navigation path with the RR in an unfamiliar, real-life environment. Participants with RR-assisted navigation were supported in wayfinding by directional audio cues of the RR-integrated navigation system. Participants without RR-assisted navigation had to complete the sections by orienting themselves along conventional signposts. Outcomes were success rate, completion and stopping time, number of stops, walking distance, and gait speed. RESULTS: The navigation assistance condition had no significant effect on the success rate in the CI, NCI, or total group. We found significant interactions between navigation assistance and cognitive status for both sections (p = 0.002-0.040), such that RR-assisted navigation reduced the completion time (both sections), stopping time (section 1), and number of stops (section 2) in the CI (p ≤ 0.001-0.014) but not in the NCI group. On the more complex section 2, RR-assisted navigation led to a reduced stopping time and walking distance in the total group (p = 0.014-0.016). CONCLUSION: The RR-integrated navigation system was effective for improving navigation within a real-life environment in potential end-users, especially in those with cognitive impairment. This is the first study to provide statistical evidence on the effectiveness of an RR-integrated navigation system in the intended user group. © 2017 S.

METHODS: The validation started with an explanation of the goals, content, and features of the simulator (content validity). Then, participants from eight different medical centers consisting of experts (> or =100 laparoscopic procedures performed) and surgical trainees (<100) were informed of the goals and received a hands-on tour of the virtual reality (VR) trainer. Subsequently, they were asked to answer 28 structured questions about the simulator (face validity). Ratings were scored on a scale from 1 (very bad/useless) to 5 (excellent/very useful). Additional comments could be given as well. Furthermore, two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, aimed at establishing concurrent validity, the training effect of a single-handed hand-eye coordination task in the simulator was compared with a similar task in a conventional box trainer and with the performance of a control group that received no training. In experiment 2 (first step of construct validity), the total score of task time, collisions, and path length of three consecutive runs in the simulator was compared between experts (>100 endoscopic procedures) and novices (no experience). RESULTS: A total of 75 participants (36 expert surgeons and 39 surgical trainees) filled out the questionnaire. Usefulness of tasks, features, and movement realism were scored between a mean value of 3.3 for depth perception and 4.3 for appreciation of training with the instrument. There were no significant differences between the mean values of the scores given by the experts and surgical trainees. In response to statements, 81% considered this VR trainer generally useful for training endoscopic techniques to residents, and 83% agreed that the simulator was useful to train hand-eye coordination. In experiment 1, the training effect for the single-handed task showed no significant difference between the conventional trainer and the VR simulator (concurrent validity). In experiment 2, experts scored significantly better than novices on all parameters used (construct validity). CONCLUSION: Content, face, and concurrent validity of the SIMENDO is established.

1060,"Experiencing nature through immersive virtual environments: Environmental perceptions, physical engagement, and affective responses during a simulated nature walk",scopus,1,1.0,,"By combining physical activity and exposure to nature, green exercise can provide additional health benefits compared to physical activity alone. Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) have emerged as a potentially valuable supplement to environmental and behavioral research, and might also provide new approaches to green exercise promotion. However, it is unknown to what extent green exercise in IVE can provide psychophysiological responses similar to those experienced in real natural environments. In this study, 26 healthy adults underwent three experimental conditions: nature walk, sitting-IVE, and treadmill-IVE. The nature walk took place on a paved trail along a large river. In the IVE conditions, the participants wore a head-mounted display with headphones reproducing a 360° video and audio of the nature walk, either sitting on a chair or walking on a manually driven treadmill. Measurements included environmental perceptions (presence and perceived environmental restorativeness - PER), physical engagement (walking speed, heart rate, and perceived exertion), and affective responses (enjoyment and affect). Additionally, qualitative information was collected through open-ended questions. The participants rated the IVEs with satisfactory levels of 'being there' and 'sense of reality,' but also reported discomforts such as 'flatness,' 'movement lag' and 'cyber sickness.' With equivalent heart rate and walking speed, participants reported higher perceived exertion in the IVEs than in the nature walk. The nature walk was associated with high enjoyment and enhanced affect. However, despite equivalent ratings of PER in the nature walk and in the IVEs, the latter were perceived as less enjoyable and gave rise to a poorer affect. Presence and PER did not differ between the two IVEs, although in the treadmill-IVE the negative affective responses had slightly smaller magnitude than in the sitting-IVE. In both the IVEs, the negative affective responses were mainly associated with cyber sickness, whereas PER was positively associated with enjoyment. From the qualitative analysis, it emerged that poor postural control and lack of a holistic sensory experience can also hinder immersion in the IVE. The results indicate that IVE technology might in future be a useful instrument in green exercise research and promotion, but only if image quality and cyber sickness can be addressed. © 2018 Calogiuri, Litleskare, Fagerheim, Rydgren, Brambilla and Thurston.",,long,short,0,0,0-1,2482,361,1,False,71245c75-eb43-9f71-3d50-d5c0459fbaaf,0-1,1536,642,1570984749915,,"{""1060"":90,""16437275"":18,""29183035"":51}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:41:55.753Z""}]",,,2.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da3532be24c3a011cc0422d,0000749d26--5da3532be24c3a011cc0422d,6401e647600a566545bc51539d2c1dd1,APPROVED,2019-10-13T16:39:07.784,2019-10-13T16:42:00.322,2019-10-13T16:42:00.322,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,86.17,,86.17,1,0,True,6,90

METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table.

27965570,Combining Exergame Training with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Effect on Neuronal Structure/Function in the Elderly Brain.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

The Nintendo Wii potentially offers a fun, convenient way of overcoming some of these. The aim was to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Mii-vitaliSe; a home-based, physiotherapist-supported Nintendo Wii intervention. DESIGN: A single-centre wait-list randomised controlled study. SETTING: MS service in secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory, relatively inactive people with clinically confirmed MS. INTERVENTION: Thirty participants were randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe either immediately (for 12 months) or after a 6-month wait (for 6 months). Mii-vitaliSe consisted of two supervised Nintendo Wii familiarisation sessions in the hospital followed by home use (Wii Sports, Sports Resort and Fit Plus software) with physiotherapist support and personalised resources. OUTCOMES: Included self-reported physical activity levels, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, fatigue and assessments of balance, gait, mobility and hand dexterity at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviews (n=25) explored participants' experiences and, at study end, the two Mii-vitaliSe facilitators' experiences of intervention delivery (main qualitative findings reported separately). RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (8.7) years, 90% female, with 47% diagnosed with MS <6 years ago and 60% new to active gaming. The recruitment rate was 31% (95% CI 20% to 44%). Outcome data were available for 29 (97%) at 6 months and 28 (93%) at 12 months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Qualitative data indicated that Mii-vitaliSe was well-received. Mean Wii use across both groups over the initial 6-month intervention period was twice a week for 27 min/day. Mean cost of delivering Mii-vitaliSe was £684 per person. DISCUSSION: Mii-vitaliSe appears acceptable and a future trial feasible and warranted. These findings will inform its design.

Motor-learning interventions are hypothesized to ameliorate motor and cognitive deficits in older adults. Especially, video game-based physical exercise might have the potential to train motor in combination with cognitive abilities in older adults. The aim of this study was to compare conventional balance training with video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, on the relative power (RP) of electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies over the PFC, executive function (EF), and gait performance. Twenty-seven participants (mean age 79.2 ± 7.3 years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. All participants completed 24 trainings including three times a 30 min session/week. The EEG measurements showed that theta RP significantly decreased in favor of the exergame group [L(14) = 6.23, p = 0.007].

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were: (1) to examine the effects of VR-augmented balance training on the sensory integration of postural control under varying attentional demands and (2) to compare the results with those of a conventional balance training (CB) group and an untrained control group. DESIGN: A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial was used. SETTING: The intervention was conducted in the clinic, and the assessment was performed in a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Forty-two people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages II-III) were recruited. INTERVENTION: The VR and CB groups received a 6-week balance training program. MEASUREMENTS: The sensory organization tests (SOTs) of computerized posturography with single- and dual-task conditions were conducted prior to training, after training, and at follow-up. Equilibrium scores, sensory ratios, and verbal reaction times (VRTs) were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in equilibrium scores or VRTs between the VR and CB groups. However, the equilibrium scores in SOT-6 (ie, unreliable vision and somatosensation) of the VR group increased significantly more than that of the control group after training. The equilibrium scores in SOT-5 (ie, unreliable somatosensation with eyes closed) of the CB group also increased significantly more than that of the control group after training. LIMITATIONS: The functional significance of the improvements in equilibrium scores in the SOTs was not known, and the sample size was small.

The ADCS Instrument Committee has previously helped to define the state of the art in assessment for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment clinical trials. We are now entering an exciting era of primary prevention trials to evaluate promising treatments that may delay disease onset and there is a need to develop appropriate instruments for these trials. The ADCS instrument committee has undertaken a project to develop instruments for prevention studies that assess domains known to be important in AD. Prevention trials are long and require large numbers of subjects, making them costly and requiring a high burden of participation for subjects. The current study focused on developing instruments that can be completed at home and in the clinic. The instruments are being evaluated in a cohort of nondemented elderly participating in a 4-year longitudinal study that simulates the design of a primary prevention trial. This report describes the design, baseline characteristics, and some longitudinal outcomes of the study cohort through the completion of the first 2 years of follow-up. We also describe the assessment domains to be measured with our new experimental instruments. This study recruited 644 subjects, 75 years of age and older. Participation in a book club that provided free books of interest to elders was offered as a recruitment incentive. Approximately 23% had some mild cognitive symptoms consistent with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5. All subjects received a standardized in-clinic evaluation at baseline, which is repeated annually for 4 years to identify cases suspected of developing dementia and to measure longitudinal change on established clinical assessments. Subjects completed a set of self-administered experimental instruments at home or in the clinic designed to assess cognitive function and behavior, global change, activities of daily living, quality of life, and resource use. An additional mail-in cognitive function questionnaire was obtained separately by mail, 1 month before the other assessments. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and validity of the home-based instruments in comparison with acquiring the same information during a clinic visit, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions in which the baseline and annual follow-up assessments are completed either at home (home group) or at the study site during their clinic visits (clinic group).

We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study of the effects of adding VR to standard therapy in adults receiving active-assisted ROM physical therapy, by assessing pain scores and maximal joint ROM immediately before and after therapy on two consecutive days. Thirty-nine inpatients, aged 21 to 57 years (mean 35 years), with a mean TBSA burn of 18% (range, 3-60%) were studied using a within-subject, crossover design. All patients received their regular pretherapy pharmacologic analgesia regimen. During physical therapy sessions on two consecutive days (VR one day and no VR the other day; order randomized), each patient participated in active-assisted ROM exercises with an occupational or physical therapist. At the conclusion of each session, patients provided 0 to 100 Graphic Rating Scale measurements of pain after each 10-minute treatment condition. On the day with VR, patients wore a head-position-tracked, medical care environment-excluding VR helmet with stereophonic sound and interacted in a virtual environment conducive to burn care. ROM measurements for each joint exercised were recorded before and after each therapy session. Because of nonsignificant carryover and order effects, the data were analyzed using simple paired t-tests. VR reduced all Graphic Rating Scale pain scores (worst pain, time spent thinking about the pain, and pain unpleasantness by 27, 37, and 31% respectively), relative to the no VR condition. Average ROM improvement was slightly greater with the VR condition; however, this difference failed to reach clinical or statistical significance (P = .243). Ninety-seven percent of patients reported zero to mild nausea after the VR session. Immersive VR effectively reduced pain and did not impair ROM during postburn physical therapy.

Exergaming, video game-based training with augmented virtual reality, may have value for improving function. The aim of the present pilot study was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of a dexterity training program using exergaming, in individuals with PD. METHODS: Ten participants with PD (aged between 55 and 75 years, Hoehn and Yahr stages II-IV) trained over a period of 4 weeks, twice a week for 30 minutes. Baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments were done. Primary outcomes with respect to feasibility were the adherence rate, open-end questions, the level of participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale), and the usability (System Usability Scale). Dexterous function was measured with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the Dexterity Questionnaire-24. Upper limb motor impairment was assessed by a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Finally, quality of life was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). RESULTS: Adherence rate was 99%, motivation increased significantly from 3.9 to 4.8 (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale, P = 0.03), and system usability of the exergaming system was acceptable to very good. Regarding potential efficacy, participants with impaired dexterity at T0 significantly improved in the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the PDQ-39. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this pilot study suggest that exergaming is feasible and has potential to improve dexterity in individuals with PD. Its efficacy should be investigated in a properly powered randomized controlled trial.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A270).",,long,medium,1,1,1-1,1941,329,1,True,71245c75-eb43-9f71-3d50-d5c0459fbaaf,1-1,1536,642,1570985303946,,"{""19692911"":28,""30233154"":101,""31136450"":33}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-13T16:51:11.863Z""}]",,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da3555574c4d8011a4002ab,0000749d26--5da3555574c4d8011a4002ab,6401e647600a566545bc51539d2c1dd1,APPROVED,2019-10-13T16:48:21.615,2019-10-13T16:51:14.538,2019-10-13T16:51:14.538,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,45.714,,45.714,4,1,True,6,33

METHOD: One hundred participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to the EG or HE group. The EG group took part in a 6-week programme using the Xbox360Kinect™ device, and the HE group took part in a 6-week balance exercise programme at home 5 days a week. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to assess balance, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to evaluate functional walking, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to assess quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants in the EG group and 42 participants in the HE group completed the study. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and pretreatment values of BBS, TUG, and SF-36. Although the BBS scores of both groups improved significantly (all p<0.05), the post-treatment scores of the EG group were better than those of the HE group. The TUG scores improved only in the EG group (p<0.05). The increase in the BBS scores and decrease in the TUG test scores were significant only in the EG group (all p<0.05). A significant improvement was also observed in the quality of life parameters of physical functioning, social role functioning, physical role restriction, general health perceptions, and physical component scores in the post-exercise evaluations of the EG group. The participants commented that they found the EG programme very entertaining.

21549352,A novel video game--based device for measuring stepping performance and fall risk in older people.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a dance mat test of choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) is reliable and can detect differences in fall risk in older adults. DESIGN: Randomized order, crossover comparison. SETTING: Balance laboratory, medical research institute, and retirement village. PARTICIPANTS: Older (mean age, 78.87±5.90y; range, 65-90y) independent-living people (N=47) able to walk in place without assistance. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reaction (RT), movement, and response times of dance pad--based stepping tests, Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) score, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, time to complete the Trail Making Test (TMT) A+B, Fall Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) score, Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale score, and Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire (IPEQ) incidental IPEQ activity subscore. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of the dance mat CSRT response time was high (intraclass correlation coefficient model 3,k=.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], .82-.94; P<.001) and correlated highly with the existing laboratory-based measure (r=.86; 95% CI, .75-.92; P<.001). Concurrent validity was shown by significant correlations between response time and measures of fall risk (PPA: r=.42; 95% CI, .15-.63; P<.01; TMT A: r=.61; 95% CI, .39-.77; TMT B: r=.55; 95% CI, .31-.72; DSST: r=-.53; 95% CI, -.71 to -.28; P<.001; FES-I: Spearman ρ=.50; 95% CI, .25-.69; ABC Scale: Spearman ρ=-.58; 95% CI, -.74 to -.35; P<.01). Participants with moderate/high fall-risk scores (PPA score >1) had significantly slower response times than people with low/mild fall-risk scores (PPA score <1) at 1146±182 and 1010±132ms, respectively (P=.005), and multiple fallers and single/nonfallers showed significant differences in RT (883±137 vs 770±100ms; P=.009) and response time (1180±195 vs 1031±145ms; P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The new dance mat device is a valid and reliable tool for assessing stepping ability and fall risk in older community-dwelling people. Because it is highly portable, it can be used in clinic settings and the homes of older people as both an assessment and training device.

25204320,Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home (SWITCH): a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Screen-based activities, such as watching television (TV), playing video games, and using computers, are common sedentary behaviors among young people and have been linked with increased energy intake and overweight. Previous home-based sedentary behaviour interventions have been limited by focusing primarily on the child, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. The SWITCH (Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home) study aimed to determine the effect of a home-based, family-delivered intervention to reduce screen-based sedentary behaviour on body composition, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet over 24 weeks in overweight and obese children. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Children and their primary caregiver living in Auckland, New Zealand were recruited via schools, community centres, and word of mouth. The intervention, delivered over 20 weeks, consisted of a face-to-face meeting with the parent/caregiver and the child to deliver intervention content, which focused on training and educating them to use a wide range of strategies designed to reduce their child's screen time. Families were given Time Machine TV monitoring devices to assist with allocating screen time, activity packages to promote alternative activities, online support via a website, and monthly newsletters. Control participants were given the intervention material on completion of follow-up. The primary outcome was change in children's BMI z-score from baseline to 24 weeks. RESULTS: Children (n = 251) aged 9-12 years and their primary caregiver were randomized to receive the SWITCH intervention (n = 127) or no intervention (controls; n = 124). There was no significant difference in change of zBMI between the intervention and control groups, although a favorable trend was observed (-0.016; 95% CI: -0.084, 0.051; p = 0.64). There were also no significant differences on secondary outcomes, except for a trend towards increased children's moderate intensity physical activity in the intervention group (24.3 min/d; 95% CI: -0.94, 49.51; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: A home-based, family-delivered intervention to reduce all leisure-time screen use had no significant effect on screen-time or on BMI at 24 weeks in overweight and obese children aged 9-12 years.

29142090,Virtual Reality Training for Upper Extremity in Subacute Stroke (VIRTUES): A multicenter RCT.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of upper extremity virtual reality rehabilitation training (VR) to time-matched conventional training (CT) in the subacute phase after stroke. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind phase III multicenter trial, 120 participants with upper extremity motor impairment within 12 weeks after stroke were consecutively included at 5 rehabilitation institutions. Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis. CONCLUSIONS: Additional upper extremity VR training was not superior but equally as effective as additional CT in the subacute phase after stroke. VR may constitute a motivating training alternative as a supplement to standard rehabilitation. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02079103.

The Nintendo Wii potentially offers a fun, convenient way of overcoming some of these. The aim was to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Mii-vitaliSe; a home-based, physiotherapist-supported Nintendo Wii intervention. DESIGN: A single-centre wait-list randomised controlled study. SETTING: MS service in secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory, relatively inactive people with clinically confirmed MS. INTERVENTION: Thirty participants were randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe either immediately (for 12 months) or after a 6-month wait (for 6 months). Mii-vitaliSe consisted of two supervised Nintendo Wii familiarisation sessions in the hospital followed by home use (Wii Sports, Sports Resort and Fit Plus software) with physiotherapist support and personalised resources. OUTCOMES: Included self-reported physical activity levels, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, fatigue and assessments of balance, gait, mobility and hand dexterity at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviews (n=25) explored participants' experiences and, at study end, the two Mii-vitaliSe facilitators' experiences of intervention delivery (main qualitative findings reported separately). RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (8.7) years, 90% female, with 47% diagnosed with MS <6 years ago and 60% new to active gaming. The recruitment rate was 31% (95% CI 20% to 44%). Outcome data were available for 29 (97%) at 6 months and 28 (93%) at 12 months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Qualitative data indicated that Mii-vitaliSe was well-received. Mean Wii use across both groups over the initial 6-month intervention period was twice a week for 27 min/day. Mean cost of delivering Mii-vitaliSe was £684 per person. DISCUSSION: Mii-vitaliSe appears acceptable and a future trial feasible and warranted. These findings will inform its design.

27965570,Combining Exergame Training with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Effect on Neuronal Structure/Function in the Elderly Brain.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax® posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) × time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups.

28946996,Motion Rehab AVE 3D: A VR-based exergame for post-stroke rehabilitation.,miller-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent researches about games for post-stroke rehabilitation have been increasing, focusing in upper limb, lower limb and balance situations, and showing good experiences and results. With this in mind, this paper presents Motion Rehab AVE 3D, a serious game for post-stroke rehabilitation of patients with mild stroke. The aim is offer a new technology in order to assist the traditional therapy and motivate the patient to execute his/her rehabilitation program, under health professional supervision. METHODS: The game was developed with Unity game engine, supporting Kinect motion sensing input device and display devices like Smart TV 3D and Oculus Rift. It contemplates six activities considering exercises in a tridimensional space: flexion, abduction, shoulder adduction, horizontal shoulder adduction and abduction, elbow extension, wrist extension, knee flexion, and hip flexion and abduction. Motion Rehab AVE 3D also report about hits and errors to the physiotherapist evaluate the patient's progress. RESULTS: A pilot study with 10 healthy participants (61-75 years old) tested one of the game levels. They experienced the 3D user interface in third-person. Our initial goal was to map a basic and comfortable setup of equipment in order to adopt later. All the participants (100%) classified the interaction process as interesting and amazing for the age, presenting a good acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation showed that the game could be used as a useful tool to motivate the patients during rehabilitation sessions. Next step is to evaluate its effectiveness for stroke patients, in order to verify if the interface and game exercises contribute into the motor rehabilitation treatment progress.

DESIGN: A total of 14 patients with strokes were recruited and randomly assigned to receive VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training. The outcome measures that were included for the study were center of pressure (COP) sway excursion, COP maximum sway in anterior-posterior direction, COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction, COP sway area, bilateral limb-loading symmetric index, the sway excursion values for the paretic foot (sway excursion/P), paretic limb stance time (stance time/P), number of steps of the paretic limb (number of steps/P), and contact area of the paretic foot (contact A/P) during quiet stance, sit-to-stand transfer, and level walking. RESULTS: There were no significant improvements in COP-related measures and symmetric index during the quiet stance, either in the VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training group (P > 0.05). However, the difference between groups after training in COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction during the quiet stance was significant (P = 0.038). Traditional treadmill training failed to improve sit-to-stand performance, whereas VR treadmill training improved symmetric index (P = 0.028) and sway excursion (P = 0.046) significantly during sit-to-stand transfer. The changes of symmetric index between groups were markedly different (P = 0.045). Finally, both groups improved significantly in stance time/P, but only VR treadmill training increased contact A/P (P = 0.034) after training during level walking. The difference between groups during level walking was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Neither traditional treadmill nor VR treadmill training had any effect on balance skill during quiet stance, but VR treadmill training improved balance skill in the medial-lateral direction better than traditional training did.

1008,3-D streaming supplying partner protocols for mobile collaborative exergaming for health,pubmed,1,1.0,,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data. The performance evaluation we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and discussed.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2447,379,1,False,25809388-9be9-f5f8-77c9-ffa45e2e3b7a,1-1,1076,605,1571055087618,,"{""1008"":16,""17135805"":5,""21474638"":2}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:11:50.450Z""}]",,,5.0,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da465e4538f39011b107bf7,0000749d26--5da465e4538f39011b107bf7,da1a7cca5ee5af2b262348a784e62c21,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:11:16.769,2019-10-14T12:12:02.676,2019-10-14T12:12:02.676,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,22.832,,22.832,1,1,True,5,16
21474638,Effects of virtual reality-augmented balance training on sensory organization and attentional demand for postural control in people with Parkinson disease: a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies related to virtual reality (VR)-augmented balance training on postural control in people with Parkinson disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were: (1) to examine the effects of VR-augmented balance training on the sensory integration of postural control under varying attentional demands and (2) to compare the results with those of a conventional balance training (CB) group and an untrained control group. DESIGN: A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial was used. SETTING: The intervention was conducted in the clinic, and the assessment was performed in a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Forty-two people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages II-III) were recruited. INTERVENTION: The VR and CB groups received a 6-week balance training program. MEASUREMENTS: The sensory organization tests (SOTs) of computerized posturography with single- and dual-task conditions were conducted prior to training, after training, and at follow-up. Equilibrium scores, sensory ratios, and verbal reaction times (VRTs) were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in equilibrium scores or VRTs between the VR and CB groups. However, the equilibrium scores in SOT-6 (ie, unreliable vision and somatosensation) of the VR group increased significantly more than that of the control group after training. The equilibrium scores in SOT-5 (ie, unreliable somatosensation with eyes closed) of the CB group also increased significantly more than that of the control group after training. LIMITATIONS: The functional significance of the improvements in equilibrium scores in the SOTs was not known, and the sample size was small. CONCLUSIONS: Both VR and CB training improved sensory integration for postural control in people with PD, especially when they were deprived of sensory redundancy.

The ADCS Instrument Committee has previously helped to define the state of the art in assessment for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment clinical trials. We are now entering an exciting era of primary prevention trials to evaluate promising treatments that may delay disease onset and there is a need to develop appropriate instruments for these trials. The ADCS instrument committee has undertaken a project to develop instruments for prevention studies that assess domains known to be important in AD. Prevention trials are long and require large numbers of subjects, making them costly and requiring a high burden of participation for subjects. The current study focused on developing instruments that can be completed at home and in the clinic. The instruments are being evaluated in a cohort of nondemented elderly participating in a 4-year longitudinal study that simulates the design of a primary prevention trial. This report describes the design, baseline characteristics, and some longitudinal outcomes of the study cohort through the completion of the first 2 years of follow-up. We also describe the assessment domains to be measured with our new experimental instruments. This study recruited 644 subjects, 75 years of age and older. Participation in a book club that provided free books of interest to elders was offered as a recruitment incentive. Approximately 23% had some mild cognitive symptoms consistent with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5. All subjects received a standardized in-clinic evaluation at baseline, which is repeated annually for 4 years to identify cases suspected of developing dementia and to measure longitudinal change on established clinical assessments. Subjects completed a set of self-administered experimental instruments at home or in the clinic designed to assess cognitive function and behavior, global change, activities of daily living, quality of life, and resource use. An additional mail-in cognitive function questionnaire was obtained separately by mail, 1 month before the other assessments. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and validity of the home-based instruments in comparison with acquiring the same information during a clinic visit, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions in which the baseline and annual follow-up assessments are completed either at home (home group) or at the study site during their clinic visits (clinic group).

Aim: This pilot clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 03069391) examined neuropsychological and neurobiological outcomes of interactive physical and mental exercise. Participants and methods: Older adults (MCI and caregivers) were enrolled in a 3-month, in-home trial of a portable neuro-exergame (the interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System [iPACES���]), in which they pedaled and steered along a virtual bike path to complete a list of errands (Memory Lane���). Neuropsychological function and salivary biomarkers were measured at pre-, mid-, and posttrial. Ten older adults complied with the recommended use of iPACES (complete dose; ���2��/wk, 67% of the 15 who also had pre- and postevaluation data). Statistical analyses compared change over time and also change among those with a complete dose vs inadequate dose. Correlations between change in neuropsychological and biomarker measures were also examined. Results: Executive function and verbal memory increased after 3 months (p = 0.01; no significant change was found with an inadequate dose). Change in salivary biomarkers was moderately associated with increasing cognition (cortisol, r = 0.68; IGF-1, r = 0.37).

31136450,Exergaming-Based Dexterity Training in Persons With Parkinson Disease: A Pilot Feasibility Study.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) suffer from impaired dexterity, which impacts activities of daily living and quality of life. Exergaming, video game-based training with augmented virtual reality, may have value for improving function. The aim of the present pilot study was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of a dexterity training program using exergaming, in individuals with PD. METHODS: Ten participants with PD (aged between 55 and 75 years, Hoehn and Yahr stages II-IV) trained over a period of 4 weeks, twice a week for 30 minutes. Baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments were done. Primary outcomes with respect to feasibility were the adherence rate, open-end questions, the level of participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale), and the usability (System Usability Scale). Dexterous function was measured with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the Dexterity Questionnaire-24. Upper limb motor impairment was assessed by a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Finally, quality of life was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). RESULTS: Adherence rate was 99%, motivation increased significantly from 3.9 to 4.8 (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale, P = 0.03), and system usability of the exergaming system was acceptable to very good. Regarding potential efficacy, participants with impaired dexterity at T0 significantly improved in the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the PDQ-39. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this pilot study suggest that exergaming is feasible and has potential to improve dexterity in individuals with PD. Its efficacy should be investigated in a properly powered randomized controlled trial.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A270).",,long,medium,1,1,1-1,1941,329,1,True,ca7022c7-8d5b-0a25-2a11-c325311adb98,1-1,1920,1012,1571055115501,,"{""18667809"":23,""30233154"":30,""31136450"":49}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:13:44.651Z""}]",,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da4660ac9709e011e0c7ce9,0000749d26--5da4660ac9709e011e0c7ce9,336e04a92a5a651b3722d7510c7fa9af,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:11:54.608,2019-10-14T12:13:46.343,2019-10-14T12:13:46.343,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,41.046,,41.046,1,1,True,6,49

We also wanted to investigate if playing computer games resulted in improved motor function in persons with prior stroke. METHODS: The intervention involved 11 patients after stroke who received extra rehabilitation by training on a computer 3 times a week during a 4-week period. The control group involved 11 patients after stroke who continued their previous rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period. The mean age of all was 68 years (range = 47-85) and the average time after stroke 66 months (range = 15-140). The VR training consisted of challenging games, which provided a range of difficulty levels that allow practice to be fun and motivating. An additional group of 11 right-handed aged matched individuals without history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses served as reference subjects. RESULTS: All the participants reported that they were novel computer game players. After an initial introduction they learned to use the VR system quickly. The treatment group demonstrated improvements in motor outcome for the trained upper extremity, but this was not detected in real-life activities. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this research suggest the usefulness of computer games in training motor performance. VR can be used beneficially not only by younger participants but also by older persons to enhance their motor performance after stroke. Copyright  2008 S.

DESIGN: Randomized order, crossover comparison. SETTING: Balance laboratory, medical research institute, and retirement village. PARTICIPANTS: Older (mean age, 78.87±5.90y; range, 65-90y) independent-living people (N=47) able to walk in place without assistance. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reaction (RT), movement, and response times of dance pad--based stepping tests, Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) score, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, time to complete the Trail Making Test (TMT) A+B, Fall Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) score, Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale score, and Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire (IPEQ) incidental IPEQ activity subscore. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of the dance mat CSRT response time was high (intraclass correlation coefficient model 3,k=.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], .82-.94; P<.001) and correlated highly with the existing laboratory-based measure (r=.86; 95% CI, .75-.92; P<.001). Concurrent validity was shown by significant correlations between response time and measures of fall risk (PPA: r=.42; 95% CI, .15-.63; P<.01; TMT A: r=.61; 95% CI, .39-.77; TMT B: r=.55; 95% CI, .31-.72; DSST: r=-.53; 95% CI, -.71 to -.28; P<.001; FES-I: Spearman ρ=.50; 95% CI, .25-.69; ABC Scale: Spearman ρ=-.58; 95% CI, -.74 to -.35; P<.01). Participants with moderate/high fall-risk scores (PPA score >1) had significantly slower response times than people with low/mild fall-risk scores (PPA score <1) at 1146±182 and 1010±132ms, respectively (P=.005), and multiple fallers and single/nonfallers showed significant differences in RT (883±137 vs 770±100ms; P=.009) and response time (1180±195 vs 1031±145ms; P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The new dance mat device is a valid and reliable tool for assessing stepping ability and fall risk in older community-dwelling people. Because it is highly portable, it can be used in clinic settings and the homes of older people as both an assessment and training device.

METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table.

25204320,Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home (SWITCH): a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Screen-based activities, such as watching television (TV), playing video games, and using computers, are common sedentary behaviors among young people and have been linked with increased energy intake and overweight. Previous home-based sedentary behaviour interventions have been limited by focusing primarily on the child, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. The SWITCH (Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home) study aimed to determine the effect of a home-based, family-delivered intervention to reduce screen-based sedentary behaviour on body composition, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet over 24 weeks in overweight and obese children. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Children and their primary caregiver living in Auckland, New Zealand were recruited via schools, community centres, and word of mouth. The intervention, delivered over 20 weeks, consisted of a face-to-face meeting with the parent/caregiver and the child to deliver intervention content, which focused on training and educating them to use a wide range of strategies designed to reduce their child's screen time. Families were given Time Machine TV monitoring devices to assist with allocating screen time, activity packages to promote alternative activities, online support via a website, and monthly newsletters. Control participants were given the intervention material on completion of follow-up. The primary outcome was change in children's BMI z-score from baseline to 24 weeks. RESULTS: Children (n = 251) aged 9-12 years and their primary caregiver were randomized to receive the SWITCH intervention (n = 127) or no intervention (controls; n = 124).

26701163,Video and computer-based interactive exercises are safe and improve task-specific balance in geriatric and neurological rehabilitation: a randomised trial.,vazquez-2018,0,1.0,,"QUESTION: Does adding video/computer-based interactive exercises to inpatient geriatric and neurological rehabilitation improve mobility outcomes? Is it feasible and safe? DESIGN: Randomised trial. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight rehabilitation inpatients. INTERVENTION: Physiotherapist-prescribed, tailored, video/computer-based interactive exercises for 1 hour on weekdays, mainly involving stepping and weight-shifting exercises. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Short Physical Performance Battery (0 to 3) at 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes were: Maximal Balance Range (mm); Step Test (step count); Rivermead Mobility Index (0 to 15); activity levels; Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Basic Mobility (18 to 72) and Daily Activity (15 to 60); Falls Efficacy Scale (10 to 40), ED5D utility score (0 to 1); Reintegration to Normal Living Index (0 to 100); System Usability Scale (0 to 100) and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (0 to 126). Safety was determined from adverse events during intervention. RESULTS: At 2 weeks the between-group difference in the primary outcome (0.1, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3) was not statistically significant. The intervention group performed significantly better than usual care for Maximal Balance Range (38mm difference after baseline adjustment, 95% CI 6 to 69). Other secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. Fifty-eight (55%) of the eligible patients agreed to participate, 25/29 (86%) completed the intervention and 10 (39%) attended > 70% of sessions, with a mean of 5.6 sessions (SD 3.3) attended and overall average duration of 4.5hours (SD 3.1). Average scores were 62 (SD 21) for the System Usability Scale and 62 (SD 8) for the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: The addition of video/computer-based interactive exercises to usual rehabilitation is a safe and feasible way to increase exercise dose, but is not suitable for all. Adding the exercises to usual rehabilitation resulted in task-specific improvements in balance but not overall mobility. REGISTRATION: ACTRN12613000610730. Copyright © 2015.

25204320,Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home (SWITCH): a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Screen-based activities, such as watching television (TV), playing video games, and using computers, are common sedentary behaviors among young people and have been linked with increased energy intake and overweight. Previous home-based sedentary behaviour interventions have been limited by focusing primarily on the child, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. The SWITCH (Screen-Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at Home) study aimed to determine the effect of a home-based, family-delivered intervention to reduce screen-based sedentary behaviour on body composition, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet over 24 weeks in overweight and obese children. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Children and their primary caregiver living in Auckland, New Zealand were recruited via schools, community centres, and word of mouth. The intervention, delivered over 20 weeks, consisted of a face-to-face meeting with the parent/caregiver and the child to deliver intervention content, which focused on training and educating them to use a wide range of strategies designed to reduce their child's screen time. Families were given Time Machine TV monitoring devices to assist with allocating screen time, activity packages to promote alternative activities, online support via a website, and monthly newsletters. Control participants were given the intervention material on completion of follow-up. The primary outcome was change in children's BMI z-score from baseline to 24 weeks. RESULTS: Children (n = 251) aged 9-12 years and their primary caregiver were randomized to receive the SWITCH intervention (n = 127) or no intervention (controls; n = 124). There was no significant difference in change of zBMI between the intervention and control groups, although a favorable trend was observed (-0.016; 95% CI: -0.084, 0.051; p = 0.64). There were also no significant differences on secondary outcomes, except for a trend towards increased children's moderate intensity physical activity in the intervention group (24.3 min/d; 95% CI: -0.94, 49.51; p = 0.06).

21549352,A novel video game--based device for measuring stepping performance and fall risk in older people.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a dance mat test of choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) is reliable and can detect differences in fall risk in older adults. DESIGN: Randomized order, crossover comparison. SETTING: Balance laboratory, medical research institute, and retirement village. PARTICIPANTS: Older (mean age, 78.87±5.90y; range, 65-90y) independent-living people (N=47) able to walk in place without assistance. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reaction (RT), movement, and response times of dance pad--based stepping tests, Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) score, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, time to complete the Trail Making Test (TMT) A+B, Fall Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) score, Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale score, and Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire (IPEQ) incidental IPEQ activity subscore. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of the dance mat CSRT response time was high (intraclass correlation coefficient model 3,k=.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], .82-.94; P<.001) and correlated highly with the existing laboratory-based measure (r=.86; 95% CI, .75-.92; P<.001). Concurrent validity was shown by significant correlations between response time and measures of fall risk (PPA: r=.42; 95% CI, .15-.63; P<.01; TMT A: r=.61; 95% CI, .39-.77; TMT B: r=.55; 95% CI, .31-.72; DSST: r=-.53; 95% CI, -.71 to -.28; P<.001; FES-I: Spearman ρ=.50; 95% CI, .25-.69; ABC Scale: Spearman ρ=-.58; 95% CI, -.74 to -.35; P<.01). Participants with moderate/high fall-risk scores (PPA score >1) had significantly slower response times than people with low/mild fall-risk scores (PPA score <1) at 1146±182 and 1010±132ms, respectively (P=.005), and multiple fallers and single/nonfallers showed significant differences in RT (883±137 vs 770±100ms; P=.009) and response time (1180±195 vs 1031±145ms; P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The new dance mat device is a valid and reliable tool for assessing stepping ability and fall risk in older community-dwelling people. Because it is highly portable, it can be used in clinic settings and the homes of older people as both an assessment and training device.

This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax® posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) × time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups.

DESIGN: A total of 14 patients with strokes were recruited and randomly assigned to receive VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training. The outcome measures that were included for the study were center of pressure (COP) sway excursion, COP maximum sway in anterior-posterior direction, COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction, COP sway area, bilateral limb-loading symmetric index, the sway excursion values for the paretic foot (sway excursion/P), paretic limb stance time (stance time/P), number of steps of the paretic limb (number of steps/P), and contact area of the paretic foot (contact A/P) during quiet stance, sit-to-stand transfer, and level walking. RESULTS: There were no significant improvements in COP-related measures and symmetric index during the quiet stance, either in the VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training group (P > 0.05). However, the difference between groups after training in COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction during the quiet stance was significant (P = 0.038). Traditional treadmill training failed to improve sit-to-stand performance, whereas VR treadmill training improved symmetric index (P = 0.028) and sway excursion (P = 0.046) significantly during sit-to-stand transfer.

We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study of the effects of adding VR to standard therapy in adults receiving active-assisted ROM physical therapy, by assessing pain scores and maximal joint ROM immediately before and after therapy on two consecutive days. Thirty-nine inpatients, aged 21 to 57 years (mean 35 years), with a mean TBSA burn of 18% (range, 3-60%) were studied using a within-subject, crossover design. All patients received their regular pretherapy pharmacologic analgesia regimen. During physical therapy sessions on two consecutive days (VR one day and no VR the other day; order randomized), each patient participated in active-assisted ROM exercises with an occupational or physical therapist. At the conclusion of each session, patients provided 0 to 100 Graphic Rating Scale measurements of pain after each 10-minute treatment condition. On the day with VR, patients wore a head-position-tracked, medical care environment-excluding VR helmet with stereophonic sound and interacted in a virtual environment conducive to burn care. ROM measurements for each joint exercised were recorded before and after each therapy session. Because of nonsignificant carryover and order effects, the data were analyzed using simple paired t-tests. VR reduced all Graphic Rating Scale pain scores (worst pain, time spent thinking about the pain, and pain unpleasantness by 27, 37, and 31% respectively), relative to the no VR condition. Average ROM improvement was slightly greater with the VR condition; however, this difference failed to reach clinical or statistical significance (P = .243). Ninety-seven percent of patients reported zero to mild nausea after the VR session. Immersive VR effectively reduced pain and did not impair ROM during postburn physical therapy.

25805886,"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neurocognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.",molina-2014,0,1.0,,"Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; treatment as usual; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment. Participants completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2 peak ml/kg/min), neurocognition (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), and serum-BDNF before and after and 12-week period. Twenty-six participants (79%) completed the study. At follow-up, the AE participants improved their AF by 18.0% vs a -0.5% decline in the TAU group (P = .002) and improved their neurocognition by 15.1% vs -2.0% decline in the TAU group (P = .031). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that enhancement in AF and increases in BDNF predicted 25.4% and 14.6% of the neurocognitive improvement variance, respectively. The results indicate AE is effective in enhancing neurocognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia and provide preliminary support for the impact of AE-related BDNF up-regulation on neurocognition in this population. Poor AF represents a modifiable risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia for which AE training offer a safe, nonstigmatizing, and side-effect-free intervention.  © The Author 2015.

This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax® posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) × time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups. However, score changes were significantly greater in the 3D-ARS group. Significant group × time interaction effect was observed for the fall risk index.

30415751,"Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii Fit PlusTM for frail older adults: A randomized feasibility clinical trial.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Recently, interactive video games (IVGs) have been used as a health-care intervention that provides both exercise and cognitive stimulation. Several studies have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ (NWFP) interactive video games, and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and (5) fear of falling (FES-I). RESULTS: Participants in the EG improved their scores in all 10 games, reported that they understood and enjoyed the tasks of the games, and presented few adverse events during the practice. There was a significant improvement in the Mini-BESTest and Functional Gait Assessment in the EG when compared with the CG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of NWFP was feasible, acceptable, and safe for frail older adults and improved their postural control and gait. There were no effects on cognition, mood, or fear of falling.

Therefore, we developed RehabMaster���, a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. METHODS: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group).

21718542,Viewing medium affects arm motor performance in 3D virtual environments.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: 2D and 3D virtual reality platforms are used for designing individualized training environments for post-stroke rehabilitation. Virtual environments (VEs) are viewed using media like head mounted displays (HMDs) and large screen projection systems (SPS) which can influence the quality of perception of the environment. We estimated if there were differences in arm pointing kinematics when subjects with and without stroke viewed a 3D VE through two different media: HMD and SPS. METHODS: Two groups of subjects participated (healthy control, n=10, aged 53.6 �� 17.2 yrs; stroke, n=20, 66.2 �� 11.3 yrs). Arm motor impairment and spasticity were assessed in the stroke group which was divided into mild (n=10) and moderate-to-severe (n=10) sub-groups based on Fugl-Meyer Scores. Subjects pointed (8 times each) to 6 randomly presented targets located at two heights in the ipsilateral, middle and contralateral arm workspaces. Movements were repeated in the same VE viewed using HMD (Kaiser XL50) and SPS. Movement kinematics were recorded using an Optotrak system (Certus, 6 markers, 100 Hz). Upper limb motor performance (precision, velocity, trajectory straightness) and movement pattern (elbow, shoulder ranges and trunk displacement) outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: For all groups, there were no differences in endpoint trajectory straightness, shoulder flexion and shoulder horizontal adduction ranges and sagittal trunk displacement between the two media. All subjects, however, made larger errors in the vertical direction using HMD compared to SPS. Healthy subjects also made larger errors in the sagittal direction, slower movements overall and used less range of elbow extension for the lower central target using HMD compared to SPS. The mild and moderate-to-severe sub-groups made larger RMS errors with HMD. The only advantage of using the HMD was that movements were 22% faster in the moderate-to-severe stroke sub-group compared to the SPS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similarity in majority of the movement kinematics, differences in movement speed and larger errors were observed for movements using the HMD. Use of the SPS may be a more comfortable and effective option to view VEs for upper limb rehabilitation post-stroke. This has implications for the use of VR applications to enhance upper limb recovery. �� 2011 Subramanian and Levin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,long,long,0,0,0-1,2427,426,1,True,ed4fd9e9-1739-399c-07d5-3916cd29de85,x-x,1280,551,1571055208903,,"{""1056"":2,""18713677"":0,""21718542"":1}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:14:36.037Z""}]",,,19.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,904c816c0885d296e3be516cb3767f39,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:13:26.243,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,67.134,,67.134,1,0,False,1,1

Continuous MTC data were collected and the first 512 data points were analyzed. The following variability indices were quantified: 1) MTC mean and standard deviation (SD), 2) PoincarE plot indices of MTC variability (SD1, SD2, SD1/SD2), 3) a wavelet based multiscale exponent beta to describe the dynamic structure of MTC fluctuations, and 4) detrended fluctuation analysis exponent alpha to investigate the presence of long-range correlations in MTC time series data. Results showed that stride-to-stride MTC time series has a nonlinear structure in all three groups when compared against randomly shuffled surrogate MTC data. Test on aging effects showed the MTC central tendency was significantly lower (p < 0.01) and the magnitude of the MTC variability significantly higher (p < 0.01). This trend changed when comparing FR subjects against age-matched HE as both the central tendency (p < 0.01) and magnitude of the variability (p < 0.01) increased significantly in FR. Although the magnitude of MTC variability increased with age, the nonlinear indices represented by alpha, beta, and SD1/SD2 demonstrated that the nonlinear structure of MTC does not change significantly due to aging (p > 0.05). There were, however, significant differences between HY and FR for beta (between scale 1 and 2; p < 0.01) and alpha (p < 0.05). Out of all the variability measures applied, beta(Wv2-4), SD1/SD2, SD2 of critical MTC parameter were found to be potential markers to be able to reliably identify FR from HE subjects. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms underlying the cause of MTC variability.",,long,long,0,0,0-0,2483,460,1,False,ed4fd9e9-1739-399c-07d5-3916cd29de85,x-x,1280,551,1571055208903,,"{""1056"":2,""18713677"":0,""21718542"":1}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:14:37.759Z""}]",,,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,904c816c0885d296e3be516cb3767f39,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:13:26.243,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,1.722,,1.722,1,0,False,1,0
1056,Long-term effects of vestibular rehabilitation and head-mounted gaming task procedure in unilateral vestibular hypofunction: a 12-month follow-up of a randomized controlled trial,scopus,1,,1.0,"Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of adding virtual reality–based home exercises to vestibular rehabilitation in people with unilateral vestibular hypofunction. Design: Follow-up otoneurological examination in two randomized groups following a previous one-month trial. Setting: Tertiary rehabilitation center. Subjects: A total of 47 patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction, one group (n = 24) undergoing conventional vestibular rehabilitation and the other one (n = 23) implementing, in addition, head-mounted gaming home exercises, 20 minutes per day for one month. Interventions: One year after completing rehabilitation, patients underwent testing with static posturography, video head impulse test, self-report questionnaires, and a performance measure. Main measures: Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain, posturographic parameters such as length, surface, and fast Fourier transform power spectra, self-report, and gait performance measure scores. Results: Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain was significantly better with respect to pretreatment in both groups. The mixed-method group showed significantly higher gain scores: mean (standard deviation (SD)) at 12 months was 0.71 (0.04), versus 0.64 (0.03) for the vestibular rehabilitation–only group (P < 0.001). Accordingly, some classical posturography scores such as surface with eyes open and length with eyes closed and low-frequency power spectra were significantly different between groups, with the virtual reality group showing improvement (P < 0.001). Self-report measures were significantly better in both groups compared to pretreatment, with significant improvement in the mixed-method group as compared to conventional rehabilitation alone: Dizziness Handicap Inventory mean total score was 24.34 (2.8) versus 35.73 (5.88) with a P-value <0.001. Conclusion: Results suggest that head-mounted gaming home exercises are a viable, effective, additional measure to improve long-term vestibular rehabilitation outcomes. © The Author(s) 2018.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2018,265,1,True,ed4fd9e9-1739-399c-07d5-3916cd29de85,1-1,1280,551,1571055208903,,"{""1056"":2,""18713677"":0,""21718542"":1}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:14:39.942Z""}]",,,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,0000749d26--5da466666b52da012271fb1f,904c816c0885d296e3be516cb3767f39,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:13:26.243,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,2019-10-14T12:14:39.963,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,2.183,,2.183,1,1,True,1,2
25241921,Spinal Cord Injury survey to determine pressure ulcer vulnerability in the outpatient population.,kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"Pressure ulcers are one of the most common causes of morbidity, mortality and rehospitalization for those living with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). Literature examining risk and recurrence of pressure ulcers (PrUs) has primarily focused on the nursing home elderly who do not have SCI. More than 200 factors that increase PrU risk have been identified. Yet unlike the elderly who incur pressure ulcers in nursing homes or when hospitalized, most persons with SCI develop their pressure ulcers as outpatients, while residing in the community. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides medical care for a large number of persons with chronic SCI. Included in the VHA SCI model of chronic disease management is the provision of an annual Comprehensive Preventive Health Evaluation, a tool that has potential to identify individuals at high risk for PrUs. This research was motivated by the clinical observation that some individuals appear to be protected from developing PrUs despite apparently 'risky' behaviors while others develop PrUs despite vigilant use of the currently known preventative measures. There is limited literature regarding protective factors and specific risk factors that reduce PrU occurrence in the community dwelling person with chronic SCI have not been delineated. The purpose of this study is to examine the preliminary hypothesis that there are biological and/or psychosocial factors that increase or reduce vulnerability to PrUs among persons with SCI. A limited number of refined hypotheses will be generated for testing in a prospective fashion. A retrospective cross-sectional survey of 119 randomly selected Veterans with SCI undergoing the Comprehensive Health Prevention Evaluation during the year 2009 was performed. Factors that differed between patients with 0, 1 or ⩾2 PrUs were identified and stratified, with an emphasis on modifiable risk factors. Three hypotheses generated from this study warrant further investigation: (1) cumulative smoking history increases the risk of PrUs independent of co-morbidities, (2) being moderately overweight, BMI>25, with or without spasticity, is a modifiable factor that may be protective and (3) increased use of a caregiver does not reduce PrU risk. Prospective studies that focus on these hypotheses will lead to evidence-based risk assessment tools and customized interventions to prevent PrUs in persons with SCI in the outpatient setting.

28330504,Competitive and cooperative arm rehabilitation games played by a patient and unimpaired person: effects on motivation and exercise intensity.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: People with chronic arm impairment should exercise intensely to regain their abilities, but frequently lack motivation, leading to poor rehabilitation outcome. One promising way to increase motivation is through interpersonal rehabilitation games, which allow patients to compete or cooperate together with other people. However, such games have mainly been evaluated with unimpaired subjects, and little is known about how they affect motivation and exercise intensity in people with chronic arm impairment. METHODS: We designed four different arm rehabilitation games that are played by a person with arm impairment and their unimpaired friend, relative or occupational therapist. One is a competitive game (both people compete against each other), two are cooperative games (both people work together against the computer) and one is a single-player game (played only by the impaired person against the computer). The games were played by 29 participants with chronic arm impairment, of which 19 were accompanied by their friend or relative and 10 were accompanied by their occupational therapist. Each participant played all four games within a single session. Participants' subjective experience was quantified using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaire after each game, as well as a final questionnaire about game preferences. Their exercise intensity was quantified using wearable inertial sensors that measured hand velocity in each game. RESULTS: Of the 29 impaired participants, 12 chose the competitive game as their favorite, 12 chose a cooperative game, and 5 preferred to exercise alone. Participants who chose the competitive game as their favorite showed increased motivation and exercise intensity in that game compared to other games. Participants who chose a cooperative game as their favorite also showed increased motivation in cooperative games, but not increased exercise intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Since both motivation and intensity are positively correlated with rehabilitation outcome, competitive games have high potential to lead to functional improvement and increased quality of life for patients compared to conventional rehabilitation exercises. Cooperative games do not increase exercise intensity, but could still increase motivation of patients who do not enjoy competition. However, such games need to be tested in longer, multisession studies to determine whether the observed increases in motivation and exercise intensity persist over a longer period of time and whether they positively affect rehabilitation outcome.

The findings described in the present paper form part of a larger study of the hopes and fears that older people hold for their future. Data were collected through a cross-sectional, population-based telephone interview survey conducted in New South Wales, Australia, from 1999 to 2000. The participants (n = 8881) were randomly selected, community-dwelling older people (>/= 65 years). Survey weights were used for estimating proportions and for all statistical inferences. The prevalence of expressing fears for the future was estimated, and analyses of selected predictors of specific fears for self were conducted by logistic regression modelling, with males and females modelled separately. The present paper focuses on two of the reported fears for self: loss of independence and nursing home admission, which have implications for healthcare and service use; and the authors identify the extent of their association with sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors.

1046,Influence of UI Complexity and Positioning on User Experience During VR Exergames,scholar,1,1.0,,"In past years, as virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast developing fields in VR are exergames, a combination of physical exercise and game. With a goal to engage people in physical activity, VR exergames should look and feel good for users. Therefore, user interface (UI) in VR is important and has to be built in a way to enhance user experience. In this paper, ergometer is used together with VR rowing environment as VR exergame for a study aiming to explore possibilities of UI in VR. Accordingly, different metrics commonly used to quantify rowing action (e.g, speed and distance) were visualized. The visualizations that were created had different positioning (closer or further away from the player) and different level of complexity (more or less metrics shown as only numbers or in a gamified design). Participants (N = 27) during experiment for this study rowed four times in different conditions depending were metrics of the game were shown: 1) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with gamified visualization of metrics; 2) as a coach boat that follows the player with gamified visualization of metrics on a screen; 3) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with digital visualization of metrics; 4) as a coach boat that follows the player with digital visualization of metrics on a screen. Results show that level of UI complexity has a significant influence on readability, while positioning of UI elements significantly influences users' perception of support from system.

21799138,Effects of an interactive computer game exercise regimen on balance impairment in frail community-dwelling older adults: a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Due to the many problems associated with reduced balance and mobility, providing an effective and engaging rehabilitation regimen is essential to progress recovery from impairments and to help prevent further degradation of motor skills. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and benefits of physical therapy based on a task-oriented approach delivered via an engaging, interactive video game paradigm. The intervention focused on performing targeted dynamic tasks, which included reactive balance controls and environmental interaction. DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in a geriatric day hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty community-dwelling and ambulatory older adults attending the day hospital for treatment of balance and mobility limitations participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS: Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed Up & Go Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures.

17444984,Fear of loss of independence and nursing home admission in older Australians.,kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"A prerequisite for the success of any health or social care policy is the ability to address the concerns of the target group. The findings described in the present paper form part of a larger study of the hopes and fears that older people hold for their future. Data were collected through a cross-sectional, population-based telephone interview survey conducted in New South Wales, Australia, from 1999 to 2000. The participants (n = 8881) were randomly selected, community-dwelling older people (>/= 65 years). Survey weights were used for estimating proportions and for all statistical inferences. The prevalence of expressing fears for the future was estimated, and analyses of selected predictors of specific fears for self were conducted by logistic regression modelling, with males and females modelled separately. The present paper focuses on two of the reported fears for self: loss of independence and nursing home admission, which have implications for healthcare and service use; and the authors identify the extent of their association with sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors. Apart from the fear of losing one's physical health, the participants' main fear for self was of losing their independence [20.4% of males, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.5-22.3%; 34.5% of females, 95% CI = 32.3-36.4%], with a specific fear of nursing home admission (4.9% of males, 95% CI = 3.9-5.9%; 9.5% of females, 95% CI = 8.3-10.6%), with confidence intervals indicating a significantly higher prevalence of both in females. Living alone was significantly associated with fear of loss of independence in females only [odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.38-1.90], and with fear of admission to a nursing home in both males and females (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.16-2.85 in males; OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.08-1.89 in females). This is the first population-based survey that has elicited fears for the future in older Australians. The findings presented here provide quantitative evidence to support policies and expansion of practices that enable older people to remain in the community for as long as possible, rather than enter institutional care prematurely. They also emphasise that, while a large proportion of older people are concerned about losing their independence, only a small minority have specific concerns about nursing home admission.",,long,long,0,0,0-0,2353,444,1,False,25809388-9be9-f5f8-77c9-ffa45e2e3b7a,0-0,1076,605,1571055269336,,"{""17444984"":9,""21799138"":5,""28330504"":1}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:14:47.305Z""}]",,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da4669ae5ae53011e1e7e48,0000749d26--5da4669ae5ae53011e1e7e48,da1a7cca5ee5af2b262348a784e62c21,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:14:18.269,2019-10-14T12:14:44.797,2019-10-14T12:14:44.797,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,12.4,,12.4,5,0,True,5,9
28330504,Competitive and cooperative arm rehabilitation games played by a patient and unimpaired person: effects on motivation and exercise intensity.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: People with chronic arm impairment should exercise intensely to regain their abilities, but frequently lack motivation, leading to poor rehabilitation outcome. One promising way to increase motivation is through interpersonal rehabilitation games, which allow patients to compete or cooperate together with other people. However, such games have mainly been evaluated with unimpaired subjects, and little is known about how they affect motivation and exercise intensity in people with chronic arm impairment. METHODS: We designed four different arm rehabilitation games that are played by a person with arm impairment and their unimpaired friend, relative or occupational therapist. One is a competitive game (both people compete against each other), two are cooperative games (both people work together against the computer) and one is a single-player game (played only by the impaired person against the computer). The games were played by 29 participants with chronic arm impairment, of which 19 were accompanied by their friend or relative and 10 were accompanied by their occupational therapist. Each participant played all four games within a single session. Participants' subjective experience was quantified using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaire after each game, as well as a final questionnaire about game preferences. Their exercise intensity was quantified using wearable inertial sensors that measured hand velocity in each game. RESULTS: Of the 29 impaired participants, 12 chose the competitive game as their favorite, 12 chose a cooperative game, and 5 preferred to exercise alone. Participants who chose the competitive game as their favorite showed increased motivation and exercise intensity in that game compared to other games. Participants who chose a cooperative game as their favorite also showed increased motivation in cooperative games, but not increased exercise intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Since both motivation and intensity are positively correlated with rehabilitation outcome, competitive games have high potential to lead to functional improvement and increased quality of life for patients compared to conventional rehabilitation exercises. Cooperative games do not increase exercise intensity, but could still increase motivation of patients who do not enjoy competition. However, such games need to be tested in longer, multisession studies to determine whether the observed increases in motivation and exercise intensity persist over a longer period of time and whether they positively affect rehabilitation outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is not a clinical trial. While human subjects are involved, they participate in a single-session evaluation of a rehabilitation game rather than a full rehabilitation intervention, and no health outcomes are examined.",,long,long,0,1,1-0,2826,453,1,True,25809388-9be9-f5f8-77c9-ffa45e2e3b7a,x-x,1076,605,1571055269336,,"{""17444984"":9,""21799138"":5,""28330504"":1}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:14:53.465Z""}]",,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da4669ae5ae53011e1e7e48,0000749d26--5da4669ae5ae53011e1e7e48,da1a7cca5ee5af2b262348a784e62c21,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:14:18.269,2019-10-14T12:14:44.797,2019-10-14T12:14:44.797,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,6.16,,6.16,5,0,False,5,1

We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study of the effects of adding VR to standard therapy in adults receiving active-assisted ROM physical therapy, by assessing pain scores and maximal joint ROM immediately before and after therapy on two consecutive days. Thirty-nine inpatients, aged 21 to 57 years (mean 35 years), with a mean TBSA burn of 18% (range, 3-60%) were studied using a within-subject, crossover design. All patients received their regular pretherapy pharmacologic analgesia regimen. During physical therapy sessions on two consecutive days (VR one day and no VR the other day; order randomized), each patient participated in active-assisted ROM exercises with an occupational or physical therapist. At the conclusion of each session, patients provided 0 to 100 Graphic Rating Scale measurements of pain after each 10-minute treatment condition. On the day with VR, patients wore a head-position-tracked, medical care environment-excluding VR helmet with stereophonic sound and interacted in a virtual environment conducive to burn care. ROM measurements for each joint exercised were recorded before and after each therapy session. Because of nonsignificant carryover and order effects, the data were analyzed using simple paired t-tests. VR reduced all Graphic Rating Scale pain scores (worst pain, time spent thinking about the pain, and pain unpleasantness by 27, 37, and 31% respectively), relative to the no VR condition. Average ROM improvement was slightly greater with the VR condition; however, this difference failed to reach clinical or statistical significance (P = .243). Ninety-seven percent of patients reported zero to mild nausea after the VR session. Immersive VR effectively reduced pain and did not impair ROM during postburn physical therapy.

24550153,Motivational interviewing in a Web-based physical activity intervention with an avatar: randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Developing Web-based physical activity (PA) interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) could increase the availability and reach of MI techniques for PA promotion. Integrating an avatar in such an intervention could lead to more positive appreciation and higher efficacy of the intervention, compared to an intervention that is purely text-based. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to determine whether a Web-based PA intervention based on MI with an avatar results in more positive appreciation and higher effectiveness of the intervention, when compared to an intervention that is purely text-based. METHODS: A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted, containing the following research conditions: (1) a Web-based PA intervention based on MI with an avatar, (2) a content-identical intervention without an avatar, and (3) a control condition that received no intervention. Measurements included PA behavior and process variables, measured at baseline, directly following the intervention and 1 month post intervention. RESULTS: Both interventions significantly increased self-reported PA at 1 month, compared to the control condition (beta(AVATARvsCONTROL)=.39, P=.011; beta(TEXTvsCONTROL)=.44, P=.006). No distinctions were found regarding intervention effect on PA between both interventions. Similarly, the results of the process evaluation did not indicate any significant differences between both interventions. Due to the limited relational skills of the avatar in this study, it probably did not succeed in forming a stronger relationship with the user, over and above text alone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that avatars that do not strengthen the social relationship with the user do not enhance the intervention impact. Future research should determine whether Web-based PA interventions based on MI could benefit from inclusion of a virtual coach capable of more complex relational skills than used in the current study, such as responding in gesture to the user's state and input.

27898369,Training the elderly in pedestrian safety: Transfer effect between two virtual reality simulation devices.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVES: A virtual-reality training program has been developed to help older pedestrians make safer street-crossing decisions in two-way traffic situations. The aim was to develop a small-scale affordable and transportable simulation device that allowed transferring effects to a full-scale device involving actual walking. METHODS: 20 younger adults and 40 older participants first participated in a pre-test phase to assess their street crossings using both full-scale and small-scale simulation devices. Then, a trained older group (20 participants) completed two 1.5-h training sessions with the small-scale device, whereas an older control group received no training (19 participants). Thereafter, the 39 older trained and untrained participants took part in a 1.5-h post-test phase again with both devices. RESULTS: Pre-test phase results suggested significant differences between both devices in the group of older participants only. Unlike younger participants, older participants accepted more often to cross and had more collisions on the small-scale simulation device than on the full-scale one. Post-test phase results showed that training older participants on the small-scale device allowed a significant global decrease in the percentage of accepted crossings and collisions on both simulation devices. But specific improvements regarding the way participants took into account the speed of approaching cars and vehicles in the far lane were notable only on the full-scale simulation device. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that the small-scale simulation device triggers a greater number of unsafe decisions compared to a full-scale one that allows actual crossings. But findings reveal that such a small-scale simulation device could be a good means to improve the safety of street-crossing decisions and behaviors among older pedestrians, suggesting a transfer of learning effect between the two simulation devices, from training people with a miniature device to measuring their specific progress with a full-scale one.

1013,Impact of Virtual Environments on Motivation and Engagement During Exergames,scopus,1,1.0,,"Video games and sport are an essential part in the life of millions of people. With recent advances of immersive virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR, the use of virtual environments (VE) for exergames is becoming more and more popular. An exergame combines a physical activity with video game elements by tracking body movements or reactions of user, attempting to engage users in a more enjoyable system. In this paper, we present the results of a subjective experiment carried out with the aim to compare different kinds of virtual environments with each other. A rowing ergometer, connected either to a virtual reality system using a head-mounted display (HMD) or to a CAVE environment, was used as an exergame device. While for rowing experts, fitness and performance improvements are of major interest, we wanted to focus on the motivation and engagement of non-professionals. By means of a series of questionnaires and a follow-up interview, the Quality of Experience of participants using the system was assessed. Measurements include concepts such as flow, presence, video quality and well-being. Results show significant advantages of the HMD as well as of the CAVE compared to a system without a VE for the overall quality, system feedback, and flow. While the CAVE and HMD system mainly differed in their autotelic experience, the HMD was favored by the majority of participants due to a superior feeling of presence.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,1469,238,1,False,70e7f852-0f0e-0e61-cab8-c2e312cff6c3,1-1,1366,574,1571055305064,,"{""1013"":8,""24550153"":8,""27898369"":7}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:15:48.162Z""}]",,,28.0,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da466c7f054ff011c0def6e,0000749d26--5da466c7f054ff011c0def6e,9b03b87b3c0a0d8604c8b02f49e46d15,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:15:03.693,2019-10-14T12:16:09.429,2019-10-14T12:16:09.429,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,43.098,,43.098,1,1,True,4,8

1003,Effects of substituting a portion of standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors,howard-2017,1,1.0,,"Background. Evidence indicates that the continuation of therapy among community-dwelling stroke survivors improves physical function. Community rehabilitation programmes often face limitations in terms of resources. It is imperative to include new motivational interventions to encourage some level of non-clinician management. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any changes in physical function and activities of daily living when substituting a portion of the standard physiotherapy time with virtual reality games among community-dwelling stroke survivors. Methods. In this controlled trial, the experimental group received 30 minutes of virtual reality balance games in addition to 90 minutes of standard physiotherapy. The control group continued with their two hours of routine standard physiotherapy. Both groups received 12 therapy sessions: two-hour sessions twice per week for six continuous weeks. Changes in physical function, activities of daily living and balance ability were assessed using the Timed Up and Go test, 30-second Sit to Stand test, Timed Ten-Metre Walk test, Six-Minute Walk test and the Barthel Index, and static balance was assessed using a probalance board. Results. Twenty-eight participants completed post-intervention assessments. The results showed a significant within-subject effect on the Timed Up and Go test: F (1, 26) = 5.83, p = 0.02; and the 30-second Sit to Stand test; F (1, 26) = 13.50, p = 0.001. The between-subject effect was not significant (p > 0.05) for any of the outcome measurements. Conclusion.

27898369,Training the elderly in pedestrian safety: Transfer effect between two virtual reality simulation devices.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVES: A virtual-reality training program has been developed to help older pedestrians make safer street-crossing decisions in two-way traffic situations. The aim was to develop a small-scale affordable and transportable simulation device that allowed transferring effects to a full-scale device involving actual walking. METHODS: 20 younger adults and 40 older participants first participated in a pre-test phase to assess their street crossings using both full-scale and small-scale simulation devices. Then, a trained older group (20 participants) completed two 1.5-h training sessions with the small-scale device, whereas an older control group received no training (19 participants). Thereafter, the 39 older trained and untrained participants took part in a 1.5-h post-test phase again with both devices. RESULTS: Pre-test phase results suggested significant differences between both devices in the group of older participants only. Unlike younger participants, older participants accepted more often to cross and had more collisions on the small-scale simulation device than on the full-scale one. Post-test phase results showed that training older participants on the small-scale device allowed a significant global decrease in the percentage of accepted crossings and collisions on both simulation devices. But specific improvements regarding the way participants took into account the speed of approaching cars and vehicles in the far lane were notable only on the full-scale simulation device. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that the small-scale simulation device triggers a greater number of unsafe decisions compared to a full-scale one that allows actual crossings. But findings reveal that such a small-scale simulation device could be a good means to improve the safety of street-crossing decisions and behaviors among older pedestrians, suggesting a transfer of learning effect between the two simulation devices, from training people with a miniature device to measuring their specific progress with a full-scale one.

24550153,Motivational interviewing in a Web-based physical activity intervention with an avatar: randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: Developing Web-based physical activity (PA) interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) could increase the availability and reach of MI techniques for PA promotion. Integrating an avatar in such an intervention could lead to more positive appreciation and higher efficacy of the intervention, compared to an intervention that is purely text-based. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to determine whether a Web-based PA intervention based on MI with an avatar results in more positive appreciation and higher effectiveness of the intervention, when compared to an intervention that is purely text-based. METHODS: A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted, containing the following research conditions: (1) a Web-based PA intervention based on MI with an avatar, (2) a content-identical intervention without an avatar, and (3) a control condition that received no intervention. Measurements included PA behavior and process variables, measured at baseline, directly following the intervention and 1 month post intervention. RESULTS: Both interventions significantly increased self-reported PA at 1 month, compared to the control condition (beta(AVATARvsCONTROL)=.39, P=.011; beta(TEXTvsCONTROL)=.44, P=.006). No distinctions were found regarding intervention effect on PA between both interventions. Similarly, the results of the process evaluation did not indicate any significant differences between both interventions. Due to the limited relational skills of the avatar in this study, it probably did not succeed in forming a stronger relationship with the user, over and above text alone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that avatars that do not strengthen the social relationship with the user do not enhance the intervention impact. Future research should determine whether Web-based PA interventions based on MI could benefit from inclusion of a virtual coach capable of more complex relational skills than used in the current study, such as responding in gesture to the user's state and input.

24393594,Assessment of postural balance in community-dwelling older adults - methodological aspects and effects of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training.,miller-2014,0,,1.0,"The overall purpose of this thesis was to examine selected methodological aspects and novel approaches for measuring postural balance older adults, and to examine the effects of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training on selected physiological, psychological and functional outcome variables in community-dwelling older adults. In Study I balance control was investigated using force plate analysis of Centre of Pressure (COP) excursion during static bilateral standing in 32 community-dwelling older adults at three different time-points (09:00, 12:30, and 16:00) throughout the day. An overall significant time-of-day effect was observed for all selected COP variables. The greatest change in all COP variables was observed (on average ~15%) between midday (12:30) and the afternoon (16:00), indicating that a systematic time-of-day influence on static postural balance exists in community-dwelling older adults. Consequently, longitudinal (i.e. pre-to-post training) comparisons of postural balance in in older adults with repeated assessments should be conducted at the same time-of-day. In Study II a novel approach for measuring postural balance (using the Nintendo Wii Stillness and Agility tests) was examined for reproducibility and concurrent validity in 30 community-dwelling older adults. While the Nintendo Wii Stillness test showed a high reproducibility, a systematic learning effect between successive sessions was observed for the Agility test. Moderate-to-excellent concurrent validity was seen for the Stillness test. In contrast, the Agility test revealed a poor concurrent validity. In conclusion, the Wii Stillness test seems to represent a low-cost objective reproducible test of postural balance in community-dwelling older adults and appears feasible in various clinical settings. A habituation (familiarization) period is necessary for the Wii Agility test to avoid a systematic learning effect between successive test sessions. Study III investigated the effect of ten weeks of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training on static postural balance, mechanical lower limb muscle function, and functional performance in 58 community-dwelling older adults. Additionally, the study investigated the participant motivation for this type of training (Exergaming). Marked improvements in maximal leg muscle strength, rapid force capacity and functional performance were observed following the period of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training. Unexpectedly, static bilateral postural balance remained unaltered following the period of intervention. The study participants perceived the Nintendo Wii training as enjoyable and highly motivating, which suggests that this type of exercise may be successfully implemented at senior citizens' centers and/or in the home of the elderly. The results presented in this thesis suggest that strict control of time-of-day is an important methodological aspect when evaluating postural balance in older adults, and an assessment protocol using the Nintendo Wii-Balance Board is reproducible and valid. Biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii exercise intervention appeared unsuccessful in improving static bilateral postural balance, most likely due to a test ceiling effect in the selected outcome measures, but the intervention elicited marked positive changes in various key risk factors associated to fall accidents. Notably, Wii based biofeedback exercise was perceived by the older adults as a highly motivating type of training.

Is transfer at odds with task specific training?,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: Transfer of motor skills is the ultimate goal of motor training in rehabilitation practice. In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. METHOD: One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6-10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. RESULTS: ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children.

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind phase III multicenter trial, 120 participants with upper extremity motor impairment within 12 weeks after stroke were consecutively included at 5 rehabilitation institutions. Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis.

Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data. The performance evaluation we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and discussed.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2447,379,1,False,01070bab-832d-b16f-c910-b0abbc90c107,x-x,393,686,1571055366775,,"{""1008"":39,""24393594"":1,""31379553"":1}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:17:48.795Z""},{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:17:53.956Z""}]",,,,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da467048d24c8010d1b4c30,0000749d26--5da467048d24c8010d1b4c30,dafeaab557749bd0e9e39733b3f7b6bc,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:16:04.491,2019-10-14T12:18:11.409,2019-10-14T12:18:11.409,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,107.181,,107.181,2,1,False,2,39
31379553,Effects of Virtual Reality-Based Physical and Cognitive Training on Executive Function and Dual-Task Gait Performance in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Control Trial,pubmed,1,,1.0,"Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.",,long,short,0,0,0-1,2215,322,1,True,01070bab-832d-b16f-c910-b0abbc90c107,0-1,393,686,1571055366775,,"{""1008"":39,""24393594"":1,""31379553"":1}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:18:02.559Z""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da467048d24c8010d1b4c30,0000749d26--5da467048d24c8010d1b4c30,dafeaab557749bd0e9e39733b3f7b6bc,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:16:04.491,2019-10-14T12:18:11.409,2019-10-14T12:18:11.409,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,8.603,,8.603,2,0,True,2,1
24393594,Assessment of postural balance in community-dwelling older adults - methodological aspects and effects of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training.,miller-2014,0,,1.0,"The overall purpose of this thesis was to examine selected methodological aspects and novel approaches for measuring postural balance older adults, and to examine the effects of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training on selected physiological, psychological and functional outcome variables in community-dwelling older adults. In Study I balance control was investigated using force plate analysis of Centre of Pressure (COP) excursion during static bilateral standing in 32 community-dwelling older adults at three different time-points (09:00, 12:30, and 16:00) throughout the day. An overall significant time-of-day effect was observed for all selected COP variables. The greatest change in all COP variables was observed (on average ~15%) between midday (12:30) and the afternoon (16:00), indicating that a systematic time-of-day influence on static postural balance exists in community-dwelling older adults. Consequently, longitudinal (i.e. pre-to-post training) comparisons of postural balance in in older adults with repeated assessments should be conducted at the same time-of-day. In Study II a novel approach for measuring postural balance (using the Nintendo Wii Stillness and Agility tests) was examined for reproducibility and concurrent validity in 30 community-dwelling older adults. While the Nintendo Wii Stillness test showed a high reproducibility, a systematic learning effect between successive sessions was observed for the Agility test. Moderate-to-excellent concurrent validity was seen for the Stillness test. In contrast, the Agility test revealed a poor concurrent validity. In conclusion, the Wii Stillness test seems to represent a low-cost objective reproducible test of postural balance in community-dwelling older adults and appears feasible in various clinical settings. A habituation (familiarization) period is necessary for the Wii Agility test to avoid a systematic learning effect between successive test sessions. Study III investigated the effect of ten weeks of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training on static postural balance, mechanical lower limb muscle function, and functional performance in 58 community-dwelling older adults. Additionally, the study investigated the participant motivation for this type of training (Exergaming). Marked improvements in maximal leg muscle strength, rapid force capacity and functional performance were observed following the period of biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii training. Unexpectedly, static bilateral postural balance remained unaltered following the period of intervention. The study participants perceived the Nintendo Wii training as enjoyable and highly motivating, which suggests that this type of exercise may be successfully implemented at senior citizens' centers and/or in the home of the elderly. The results presented in this thesis suggest that strict control of time-of-day is an important methodological aspect when evaluating postural balance in older adults, and an assessment protocol using the Nintendo Wii-Balance Board is reproducible and valid. Biofeedback-based Nintendo Wii exercise intervention appeared unsuccessful in improving static bilateral postural balance, most likely due to a test ceiling effect in the selected outcome measures, but the intervention elicited marked positive changes in various key risk factors associated to fall accidents. Notably, Wii based biofeedback exercise was perceived by the older adults as a highly motivating type of training.

24597650,A task-specific interactive game-based virtual reality rehabilitation system for patients with stroke: a usability test and two clinical experiments.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster���, a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. METHODS: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded. RESULTS: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P = .03) and MBI (P = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (P = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were reported.

Exercise-based video gaming (exergaming) is a form of physical training that is delivered through virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is efficacious in improving balance in aged populations. In addition, studies have shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), when applied to the primary motor cortex, can augment motor learning when combined with physical training. However, no studies have investigated the combined effects of exergaming and tDCS on balance in people with PD. METHODS/DESIGN: Twenty-four people with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale score 2-4) will be randomly allocated to receive one of three interventions: (1) exergaming + a-tDCS, (2) exergaming + sham a-tDCS or (3) usual care. Participants in each exergaming group will perform two training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each exergaming session will consist of a series of static and dynamic balance exercises using a rehabilitation-specific software programme (Jintronix) and 20 minutes of either sham or real a-tDCS (2 mA) delivered concurrently. Participants allocated to usual care will be asked to maintain their normal daily physical activities. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks (mid-intervention), 12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (3-month follow-up) after baseline.

PARTICIPANTS: Thirty community-dwelling and ambulatory older adults attending the day hospital for treatment of balance and mobility limitations participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS: Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed Up & Go Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures. CONCLUSION: Dynamic balance exercises on fixed and compliant sponge surfaces were feasibly coupled to interactive game-based exercise. This coupling, in turn, resulted in a greater improvement in dynamic standing balance control compared with the typical exercise program. However, there was no transfer of effect to gait function.",,long,long,0,1,1-0,2592,414,1,True,48119882-14e1-3ad1-14bc-0f4d73ca9728,1-0,1536,670,1571055395881,,"{""21799138"":8,""28382812"":9,""30012175"":8}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:17:03.878Z""}]",,,2.0,,1-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da46721f054ff011c0df771,0000749d26--5da46721f054ff011c0df771,59d1a77c2ba72f1dec723731f91fcc27,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:16:33.670,2019-10-14T12:17:09.869,2019-10-14T12:17:09.869,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,6.798,,6.798,2,0,True,4,8
28382812,Cognitive effects of weight-shifting controlled exergames in patients with chronic stroke: a pilot randomized comparison trial.,molina-2014,0,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: The exergaming training involves motor as well as cognitive stimulation. Although exergame studies have been reported to have benefits in motor function, the effects of exergames on improving cognitive function remain inconclusive. Moreover, no study has been reported in stroke patients. AIM: The objective of this study was to compare the cognitive effects of 2 weight-shifting controlled exergaming systems and conventional weight- shifting training in patients with chronic stroke. DESIGN: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: All participants were recruited from a rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. POPULATION: Patients (N.=37) with chronic hemiplegic stroke. METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to one of the Wii Fit, Tetrax biofeedback, or conventional weight-shifting training groups. All interventions were administered 30 minutes per session, twice a week for 12 weeks. We used total score and the 9 domain scores of Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument Chinese version (CASI C-2.0), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) as the outcome measures. The outcome measures were assessed before and after training, and at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in the percentage of change in CASI total score and BBS, either post intervention or at the 3-month follow-up. At assessing the percentage of change in each domain of CASI, we found significant differences among the 3 groups in the abstraction/judgment domain after intervention (Wii Fit 16.25 [9.77, 37.50]% vs. Tetrax 0.00 [-10.00, 0.00]% vs. weight-shift 11.00 [0.00, 14.38]%, P=0.01], and at the 3-month follow-up (Wii Fit 20.00 [10.83, 31.25]% vs. Tetrax -10.00 [-11.11, 10.00]% vs. weight-shifting 0.00 [-2.27, 11.46]%, P=0.01). The differences came from the differences between Wii Fit and Tetrax mainly. There were significant differences among the 3 groups in language domain after intervention (Wii Fit 0.00 [0.00, 5.54]% vs. Tetrax 0.00 [-3.00, 0.00]% vs. weight-shift 0.00 [0.00, 0.00]%, P=0.045), but not at the 3-month follow-up (P=0.13). There was no correlation between the percentage of change in BBS and CASI total score postintervention ( r=-0.15 P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Wii Fit games training might be beneficial in some cognitive functions, such as abstraction/judgment, language in patients with chronic stroke. Wii Fit games, the commercial entertainment exergames, had superior effect in abstract/judgment and language domains as compared to the rehabilitation exergame (Tetrax balance system). Hence, Wii Fit games might be considered as a tool in post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation programs.",,long,long,0,1,1-0,2683,488,1,True,ca7022c7-8d5b-0a25-2a11-c325311adb98,1-0,1920,1012,1571055836527,,"{""28382812"":40,""29142090"":23,""30012175"":27}",0,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:27:00.978Z""}]",,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da468db6b52da0122723958,0000749d26--5da468db6b52da0122723958,336e04a92a5a651b3722d7510c7fa9af,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:23:55.298,2019-10-14T12:28:05.705,2019-10-14T12:28:05.705,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,184.451,,184.451,4,0,True,6,40
30012175,Concurrent exergaming and transcranial direct current stimulation to improve balance in people with Parkinson's disease: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly experience postural instability, resulting in poor balance and an increased risk of falls. Exercise-based video gaming (exergaming) is a form of physical training that is delivered through virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is efficacious in improving balance in aged populations. In addition, studies have shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), when applied to the primary motor cortex, can augment motor learning when combined with physical training. However, no studies have investigated the combined effects of exergaming and tDCS on balance in people with PD. METHODS/DESIGN: Twenty-four people with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale score 2-4) will be randomly allocated to receive one of three interventions: (1) exergaming + a-tDCS, (2) exergaming + sham a-tDCS or (3) usual care. Participants in each exergaming group will perform two training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each exergaming session will consist of a series of static and dynamic balance exercises using a rehabilitation-specific software programme (Jintronix) and 20 minutes of either sham or real a-tDCS (2 mA) delivered concurrently. Participants allocated to usual care will be asked to maintain their normal daily physical activities. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks (mid-intervention), 12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (3-month follow-up) after baseline. The primary outcome measure will be the Limits of Stability Test. Secondary outcomes will include measures of static balance, leg strength, functional capacity, cognitive task-related cortical activation, corticospinal excitability and inhibition, and cognitive inhibition. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to target balance in people with PD with combined exergaming and a-tDCS. We hypothesise that improvements in balance, functional and neurophysiological outcome measures, and neurocognitive outcome measures will be greater and longer-lasting following concurrent exergaming and a-tDCS than in those receiving sham tDCS or usual care.

29142090,Virtual Reality Training for Upper Extremity in Subacute Stroke (VIRTUES): A multicenter RCT.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of upper extremity virtual reality rehabilitation training (VR) to time-matched conventional training (CT) in the subacute phase after stroke. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind phase III multicenter trial, 120 participants with upper extremity motor impairment within 12 weeks after stroke were consecutively included at 5 rehabilitation institutions. Participants were randomized to either VR or CT as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation and stratified according to mild to moderate or severe hand paresis, defined as ���20 degrees wrist and 10 degrees finger extension or less, respectively. The training comprised a minimum of sixteen 60-minute sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); secondary outcome measures were the Box and Blocks Test and Functional Independence Measure. Patients were assessed at baseline, after intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean time from stroke onset for the VR group was 35 (SD 21) days and for the CT group was 34 (SD 19) days. There were no between-group differences for any of the outcome measures. Improvement of upper extremity motor function assessed with ARAT was similar at the postintervention (p = 0.714) and follow-up (p = 0.777) assessments. Patients in VR improved 12 (SD 11) points from baseline to the postintervention assessment and 17 (SD 13) points from baseline to follow-up, while patients in CT improved 13 (SD 10) and 17 (SD 13) points, respectively. Improvement was also similar for our subgroup analysis with mild to moderate and severe upper extremity paresis. CONCLUSIONS: Additional upper extremity VR training was not superior but equally as effective as additional CT in the subacute phase after stroke. VR may constitute a motivating training alternative as a supplement to standard rehabilitation. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02079103.

23857741,High-sensitivity CRP is an independent risk factor for all fractures and vertebral fractures in elderly men: the MrOS Sweden study.,kelly-2018,0,,1.0,"Epidemiological studies have shown low-grade inflammation measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to be associated with fracture risk in women. However, it is still unclear whether hs-CRP is also associated with fracture risk in men. We therefore measured serum levels of hs-CRP in 2910 men, mean age 75 years, included in the prospective population-based MrOS Sweden cohort. Study participants were divided into tertile groups based on hs-CRP level. Fractures occurring after the baseline visit were validated (average follow-up 5.4 years). The incidence for having at least one fracture after baseline was 23.9 per 1000 person-years. In Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusted for age, hs-CRP was related to fracture risk. The hazard ratio (HR) of fracture for the highest tertile of hs-CRP, compared with the lowest and the medium tertiles combined, was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.20-1.82). Multivariate adjustment for other risk factors for fractures had no major effect on the associations between hs-CRP and fracture. Results were essentially unchanged after exclusion of subjects with hs-CRP levels greater than 7.5 mg/L, as well as after exclusion of subjects with a first fracture within 3 years of follow-up, supporting that the associations between hs-CRP and fracture risk were not merely a reflection of a poor health status at the time of serum sampling. Femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) was not associated with hs-CRP, and the predictive role of hs-CRP for fracture risk was essentially unchanged when femoral neck BMD was added to the model (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09-1.72). Exploratory subanalyses of fracture type demonstrated that hs-CRP was clearly associated with clinical vertebral fractures (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.12-2.29). We demonstrate, using a large prospective population-based study, that elderly men with high hs-CRP have increased risk of fractures, and that these fractures are mainly vertebral. The association between hs-CRP and fractures was independent of BMD.

21718542,Viewing medium affects arm motor performance in 3D virtual environments.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: 2D and 3D virtual reality platforms are used for designing individualized training environments for post-stroke rehabilitation. Virtual environments (VEs) are viewed using media like head mounted displays (HMDs) and large screen projection systems (SPS) which can influence the quality of perception of the environment. We estimated if there were differences in arm pointing kinematics when subjects with and without stroke viewed a 3D VE through two different media: HMD and SPS. METHODS: Two groups of subjects participated (healthy control, n=10, aged 53.6 �� 17.2 yrs; stroke, n=20, 66.2 �� 11.3 yrs). Arm motor impairment and spasticity were assessed in the stroke group which was divided into mild (n=10) and moderate-to-severe (n=10) sub-groups based on Fugl-Meyer Scores. Subjects pointed (8 times each) to 6 randomly presented targets located at two heights in the ipsilateral, middle and contralateral arm workspaces. Movements were repeated in the same VE viewed using HMD (Kaiser XL50) and SPS. Movement kinematics were recorded using an Optotrak system (Certus, 6 markers, 100 Hz). Upper limb motor performance (precision, velocity, trajectory straightness) and movement pattern (elbow, shoulder ranges and trunk displacement) outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: For all groups, there were no differences in endpoint trajectory straightness, shoulder flexion and shoulder horizontal adduction ranges and sagittal trunk displacement between the two media. All subjects, however, made larger errors in the vertical direction using HMD compared to SPS. Healthy subjects also made larger errors in the sagittal direction, slower movements overall and used less range of elbow extension for the lower central target using HMD compared to SPS. The mild and moderate-to-severe sub-groups made larger RMS errors with HMD. The only advantage of using the HMD was that movements were 22% faster in the moderate-to-severe stroke sub-group compared to the SPS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similarity in majority of the movement kinematics, differences in movement speed and larger errors were observed for movements using the HMD. Use of the SPS may be a more comfortable and effective option to view VEs for upper limb rehabilitation post-stroke. This has implications for the use of VR applications to enhance upper limb recovery. �� 2011 Subramanian and Levin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,long,long,0,0,0-1,2427,426,1,True,5959602e-5421-dd64-3c35-971ba8c7ab37,0-1,1920,888,1571055918927,,"{""21718542"":5,""23857741"":12,""24662811"":8}",maybe,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:25:36.602Z""}]",,,1.0,,0-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da4692d1de93a011bcfc661,0000749d26--5da4692d1de93a011bcfc661,02c210843d86f923cb20d54596582f27,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:25:17.885,2019-10-14T12:25:39.804,2019-10-14T12:25:39.804,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,3.608,,3.608,1,0,True,1,5
1013,Impact of Virtual Environments on Motivation and Engagement During Exergames,scopus,1,1.0,,"Video games and sport are an essential part in the life of millions of people. With recent advances of immersive virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR, the use of virtual environments (VE) for exergames is becoming more and more popular. An exergame combines a physical activity with video game elements by tracking body movements or reactions of user, attempting to engage users in a more enjoyable system. In this paper, we present the results of a subjective experiment carried out with the aim to compare different kinds of virtual environments with each other. A rowing ergometer, connected either to a virtual reality system using a head-mounted display (HMD) or to a CAVE environment, was used as an exergame device. While for rowing experts, fitness and performance improvements are of major interest, we wanted to focus on the motivation and engagement of non-professionals. By means of a series of questionnaires and a follow-up interview, the Quality of Experience of participants using the system was assessed. Measurements include concepts such as flow, presence, video quality and well-being. Results show significant advantages of the HMD as well as of the CAVE compared to a system without a VE for the overall quality, system feedback, and flow. While the CAVE and HMD system mainly differed in their autotelic experience, the HMD was favored by the majority of participants due to a superior feeling of presence.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,1469,238,1,False,7f8c0f22-9652-092d-5ecd-5616c72287b5,1-1,1360,574,1571055925436,,"{""1013"":3,""23857741"":4,""24662811"":2}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:25:50.958Z""}]",,,4.0,,1-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da46933046a7701204e9273,0000749d26--5da46933046a7701204e9273,e449bbdc27101b3a689b98df05e147fa,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:25:23.689,2019-10-14T12:26:01.338,2019-10-14T12:26:01.338,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,25.522,,25.522,2,1,True,4,3

However, it is still unclear whether hs-CRP is also associated with fracture risk in men. We therefore measured serum levels of hs-CRP in 2910 men, mean age 75 years, included in the prospective population-based MrOS Sweden cohort. Study participants were divided into tertile groups based on hs-CRP level. Fractures occurring after the baseline visit were validated (average follow-up 5.4 years). The incidence for having at least one fracture after baseline was 23.9 per 1000 person-years. In Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusted for age, hs-CRP was related to fracture risk. The hazard ratio (HR) of fracture for the highest tertile of hs-CRP, compared with the lowest and the medium tertiles combined, was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.20-1.82). Multivariate adjustment for other risk factors for fractures had no major effect on the associations between hs-CRP and fracture. Results were essentially unchanged after exclusion of subjects with hs-CRP levels greater than 7.5 mg/L, as well as after exclusion of subjects with a first fracture within 3 years of follow-up, supporting that the associations between hs-CRP and fracture risk were not merely a reflection of a poor health status at the time of serum sampling. Femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) was not associated with hs-CRP, and the predictive role of hs-CRP for fracture risk was essentially unchanged when femoral neck BMD was added to the model (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09-1.72). Exploratory subanalyses of fracture type demonstrated that hs-CRP was clearly associated with clinical vertebral fractures (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.12-2.29).

24662811,Gravity-supported exercise with computer gaming improves arm function in chronic stroke.,molina-2014,1,,1.0,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 4 to 6 weeks of exergaming with a computer mouse embedded within an arm skate on upper limb function in survivors of chronic stroke. DESIGN: Intervention study with a 4-week postintervention follow-up. SETTING: In home. PARTICIPANTS: Survivors (N=13) of chronic (���6 mo) stroke with hemiparesis of the upper limb with stable baseline Fugl-Meyer assessment scores received the intervention. One participant withdrew, and 2 participants were not reassessed at the 4-week follow-up. No participants withdrew as a result of adverse effects. INTERVENTION: Four to 6 weeks of exergaming using the arm skate where participants received either 9 (n=5) or 16 (n=7) hours of game play. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Upper limb component of the Fugl-Meyer assessment. RESULTS: There was an average increase in the Fugl-Meyer upper limb assessment score from the beginning to end of the intervention of 4.9 points. At the end of the 4-week period after the intervention, the increase was 4.4 points.

25805886,"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neurocognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.",molina-2014,0,1.0,,"Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; treatment as usual; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment. Participants completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2 peak ml/kg/min), neurocognition (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), and serum-BDNF before and after and 12-week period. Twenty-six participants (79%) completed the study. At follow-up, the AE participants improved their AF by 18.0% vs a -0.5% decline in the TAU group (P = .002) and improved their neurocognition by 15.1% vs -2.0% decline in the TAU group (P = .031). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that enhancement in AF and increases in BDNF predicted 25.4% and 14.6% of the neurocognitive improvement variance, respectively. The results indicate AE is effective in enhancing neurocognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia and provide preliminary support for the impact of AE-related BDNF up-regulation on neurocognition in this population. Poor AF represents a modifiable risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia for which AE training offer a safe, nonstigmatizing, and side-effect-free intervention.  © The Author 2015.

25448245,"Effectiveness, usability, and cost-benefit of a virtual reality-based telerehabilitation program for balance recovery after stroke: a randomized controlled trial.",molina-2014,0,,1.0,"OBJECTIVES: First, to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based telerehabilitation program in the balance recovery of individuals with hemiparesis after stroke in comparison with an in-clinic program; second, to compare the subjective experiences; and third, to contrast the costs of both programs. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Neurorehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic outpatients with stroke (N=30) with residual hemiparesis. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty 45-minute training sessions with the telerehabilitation system, conducted 3 times a week, in the clinic or in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Berg Balance Scale for balance assessment. The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment balance and gait subscales, and the Brunel Balance Assessment were secondary outcome measures. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). Second, the System Usability Scale and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for subjective experiences. Third, cost (in dollars). RESULTS: Significant improvement in both groups (in-clinic group [control] and a home-based telerehabilitation group) from the initial to the final assessment in the Berg Balance Scale (��p(2)=.68; P=.001), in the balance (��p(2)=.24; P=.006) and gait (��p(2)=.57, P=.001) subscales of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, and in the Brunel Balance Assessment (control: ��(2)=15.0; P=.002; experimental: ��(2)=21.9; P=.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in any balance scale or in the feedback questionnaires. With regard to subjective experiences, both groups considered the VR system similarly usable and motivating. The in-clinic intervention resulted in more expenses than did the telerehabilitation intervention ($654.72 per person). CONCLUSIONS: First, VR-based telerehabilitation interventions can promote the reacquisition of locomotor skills associated with balance in the same way as do in-clinic interventions, both complemented with a conventional therapy program; second, the usability of and motivation to use the 2 interventions can be similar; and third, telerehabilitation interventions can involve savings that vary depending on each scenario.

1054,An interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework based on 3D immersive serious games,scopus,1,,1.0,"Strokes, surgeries, or degenerative diseases can impair motor abilities and balance. Long-term rehabilitation is often the only way to recover, as completely as possible, these lost skills. To be effective, this type of rehabilitation should follow three main rules. First, rehabilitation exercises should be able to keep patient's motivation high. Second, each exercise should be customizable depending on patient's needs. Third, patient's performance should be evaluated objectively, i.e., by measuring patient's movements with respect to an optimal reference model. To meet the just reported requirements, in this paper, an interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework for the generation of 3D immersive serious games is proposed. The framework combines two Natural User Interfaces (NUIs), for hand and body modeling, respectively, and a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to provide the patient with an interactive and highly defined Virtual Environment (VE) for playing with stimulating rehabilitation exercises. The paper presents the overall architecture of the framework, including the environment for the generation of the pilot serious games and the main features of the used hand and body models. The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown on a group of ninety-two patients. In a first stage, a pool of seven rehabilitation therapists has evaluated the results of the patients on the basis of three reference rehabilitation exercises, confirming a significant gradual recovery of the patients’ skills. Moreover, the feedbacks received by the therapists and patients, who have used the system, have pointed out remarkable results in terms of motivation, usability, and customization. In a second stage, by comparing the current state-of-the-art in rehabilitation area with the proposed system, we have observed that the latter can be considered a concrete contribution in terms of versatility, immersivity, and novelty. In a final stage, by training a Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) with healthy subjects (i.e., baseline), we have also provided a reference model to objectively evaluate the degree of the patients’ performance.

25212521,Patients' use of a home-based virtual reality system to provide rehabilitation of the upper limb following stroke.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: A low-cost virtual reality system that translates movements of the hand, fingers, and thumb into game play was designed to provide a flexible and motivating approach to increasing adherence to home-based rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness depends on adherence, so did patients use the intervention to the recommended level? If not, what reasons did they give? The purpose of this study was to investigate these and related questions. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, plus qualitative analysis of interviews, was conducted. METHODS: Seventeen patients recovering from stroke recruited to the intervention arm of a feasibility trial had the equipment left in their homes for 8 weeks and were advised to use it 3 times a day for periods of no more than 20 minutes. Frequency and duration of use were automatically recorded. At the end of the intervention, participants were interviewed to determine barriers to using it in the recommended way. RESULTS: Duration of use and how many days they used the equipment are presented for the 13 participants who successfully started the intervention. These figures were highly variable and could fall far short of our recommendations. There was a weak positive correlation between duration and baseline reported activities of daily living. Participants reported lack of familiarity with technology and competing commitments as barriers to use, although they appreciated the flexibility of the intervention and found it motivating. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Level of use is variable and can fall far short of recommendations. Competing commitments were a barrier to use of the equipment, but participants reported that the intervention was flexible and motivating. It will not suit everyone, but some participants recorded high levels of use.

METHOD: One hundred participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to the EG or HE group. The EG group took part in a 6-week programme using the Xbox360Kinect™ device, and the HE group took part in a 6-week balance exercise programme at home 5 days a week. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to assess balance, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to evaluate functional walking, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to assess quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants in the EG group and 42 participants in the HE group completed the study. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and pretreatment values of BBS, TUG, and SF-36. Although the BBS scores of both groups improved significantly (all p<0.05), the post-treatment scores of the EG group were better than those of the HE group. The TUG scores improved only in the EG group (p<0.05). The increase in the BBS scores and decrease in the TUG test scores were significant only in the EG group (all p<0.05). A significant improvement was also observed in the quality of life parameters of physical functioning, social role functioning, physical role restriction, general health perceptions, and physical component scores in the post-exercise evaluations of the EG group. The participants commented that they found the EG programme very entertaining. CONCLUSION: The EG can be considered a safe, entertaining and sustainable alternative to HE programmes, and it may have positive effects on balance, functional walking and quality of life in geriatric subjects.

In a first stage, a pool of seven rehabilitation therapists has evaluated the results of the patients on the basis of three reference rehabilitation exercises, confirming a significant gradual recovery of the patients’ skills. Moreover, the feedbacks received by the therapists and patients, who have used the system, have pointed out remarkable results in terms of motivation, usability, and customization. In a second stage, by comparing the current state-of-the-art in rehabilitation area with the proposed system, we have observed that the latter can be considered a concrete contribution in terms of versatility, immersivity, and novelty. In a final stage, by training a Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) with healthy subjects (i.e., baseline), we have also provided a reference model to objectively evaluate the degree of the patients’ performance. To estimate the effectiveness of this last aspect of the proposed approach, we have used the NTU RGB + D Action Recognition dataset obtaining comparable results with the current literature in action recognition.",,long,short,1,1,1-1,2388,353,1,False,70e7f852-0f0e-0e61-cab8-c2e312cff6c3,1-1,1366,574,1571055973533,,"{""1054"":2,""25448245"":3,""26849537"":12}",1,,,"[{""time"":""2019-10-14T12:26:33.399Z""}]",,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/7642406/0000749d26--5da469645a96af011f13aae9,0000749d26--5da469645a96af011f13aae9,9b03b87b3c0a0d8604c8b02f49e46d15,APPROVED,2019-10-14T12:26:12.352,2019-10-14T12:26:41.241,2019-10-14T12:26:41.241,0.15,7642406,fine-grained-one-vr,4.086,,4.086,4,1,True,4,2

DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Neurorehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic outpatients with stroke (N=30) with residual hemiparesis. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty 45-minute training sessions with the telerehabilitation system, conducted 3 times a week, in the clinic or in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Berg Balance Scale for balance assessment. The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment balance and gait subscales, and the Brunel Balance Assessment were secondary outcome measures. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). Second, the System Usability Scale and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for subjective experiences. Third, cost (in dollars). RESULTS: Significant improvement in both groups (in-clinic group [control] and a home-based telerehabilitation group) from the initial to the final assessment in the Berg Balance Scale (��p(2)=.68; P=.001), in the balance (��p(2)=.24; P=.006) and gait (��p(2)=.57, P=.001) subscales of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, and in the Brunel Balance Assessment (control: ��(2)=15.0; P=.002; experimental: ��(2)=21.9; P=.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in any balance scale or in the feedback questionnaires. With regard to subjective experiences, both groups considered the VR system similarly usable and motivating. The in-clinic intervention resulted in more expenses than did the telerehabilitation intervention ($654.72 per person). CONCLUSIONS: First, VR-based telerehabilitation interventions can promote the reacquisition of locomotor skills associated with balance in the same way as do in-clinic interventions, both complemented with a conventional therapy program; second, the usability of and motivation to use the 2 interventions can be similar; and third, telerehabilitation interventions can involve savings that vary depending on each scenario.

17012641,Effect of a virtual reality-enhanced exercise protocol after coronary artery bypass grafting.,miller-2014,1,,1.0,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) technology has gained importance in many areas of medicine. Knowledge concerning the application and the influence of VR-enhanced exercise programs is limited for patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a virtual country walk on the number of sessions necessary to reach cardiac rehabilitation goals in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. SUBJECTS: Twenty subjects who were seen for cardiac rehabilitation between January and June 2004 comprised the study sample. METHODS: The protocol for this study included an initial maximum graded exercise tolerance test, given to determine the subsequent training goals for the subject, followed by biweekly submaximal endurance training sessions. All subjects were assigned by lot to 1 of 2 submaximal endurance training programs, one (group 2) with and the other (group 1) without the added VR environment. In all other respects, the 2 programs were identical. Each training session lasted for 30 minutes and was carried out twice per week for about 3 months. The primary outcome measures were maximum load during the work sessions, target oxygen consumption, target heart rate (beats per minute), and number of training sessions required to reach rehabilitation goals. RESULTS: By the end of 20 training sessions, only 4 of the 10 control subjects had reached the heart rate target goal of 85% their maximum heart rate. In contrast, 9 of the 10 subjects in the VR program had attained this goal by 9 or fewer training sessions. When target metabolic cost (75% peak oxygen consumption) was used as the training goal, all 10 subjects in the VR program had reached this target after 2 training sessions (or, in some cases, 1 training session), but not until training session 15 did a cumulative number of 9 control subjects reach this goal.

30823460,Frailty Level Monitoring and Analysis after a Pilot Six-Week Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Using the FRED Exergame Including Biofeedback Supervision in an Elderly Day Care Centre.,vazquez-2018,0,,1.0,"Background: Frailty is a status of extreme vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors exposing the individual to a higher risk of negative health-related outcomes. Exercise using interactive videos, known as exergames, is being increasingly used to increase physical activity by improving health and the physical function in elderly adults. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the reduction in the degree of frailty, the degree of independence in activities of daily living, the perception of one's state of health, safety and cardiac healthiness by the exercise done using FRED over a 6-week period in elderly day care centre. Material and Methods: Frail volunteers >65 years of age, with a score of <10 points (SPPB), took part in the study. A study group and a control group of 20 participants respectively were obtained. Following randomisation, the study group (20) took part in 18 sessions in total over 6 months, and biofeedback was recorded in each session. Results: After 6 weeks, 100% of patients from the control group continued evidencing frailty risk, whereas only 5% of patients from the study group did so, with p < 0.001 statistical significance. In the case of the EQ-VAS, the control group worsened (-12.63 points) whereas the study group improved (12.05 points). The Barthel Index showed an improvement in the study group after 6 weeks, with statistically significant evidence and a value of p < 0.003906. Safety compliance with the physical activity exceeded 87% and even improved as the days went by. Discussion: Our results stand out from those obtained by other authors in that FRED is an ad hoc-designed exergame, significantly reduced the presence and severity of frailty in a sample of sedentary elders, thus potentially modifying their risk profile. It in turn improves the degree of independence in activities of daily living and the perception of one's state of health, proving to be a safe and cardiac healthy exercise. Conclusions: The study undertaken confirms the fact that the FRED game proves to be a valid technological solution for reducing frailty risk.

29149855,Increasing upper limb training intensity in chronic stroke using embodied virtual reality: a pilot study.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. METHODS: Ten outpatient stroke survivors with chronic (>6��months) upper extremity paresis participated in a ten-session VR-based upper limb rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week). RESULTS: All participants completed all sessions of the treatment. In total, they received a median of 403��min of upper limb therapy, with 290��min of effective training. Within that time, participants performed a median of 4713 goal-directed movements. Importantly, training intensity increased progressively across sessions from 13.2 to 17.3 movements per minute. Clinical measures show that despite being in the chronic phase, where recovery potential is thought to be limited, participants showed a median improvement rate of 5.3% in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity; FMA-UE) post intervention compared to baseline, and of 15.4% at one-month follow-up. For three of them, this improvement was clinically significant. A significant improvement in shoulder active range of motion (AROM) was also observed at follow-up. Participants reported very low levels of pain, stress and fatigue following each session of training, indicating that the intensive VR intervention was well tolerated. No severe adverse events were reported. All participants expressed their interest in continuing the intervention at the hospital or even at home, suggesting high levels of adherence and motivation for the provided intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed how a dedicated VR system could deliver high rehabilitation doses and, importantly, intensive training in chronic stroke survivors. FMA-UE and AROM results suggest that task-specific VR training may be beneficial for further functional recovery both in the chronic stage of stroke. Longitudinal studies with higher doses and sample sizes are required to confirm the therapy effectiveness.

1054,An interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework based on 3D immersive serious games,scopus,1,,1.0,"Strokes, surgeries, or degenerative diseases can impair motor abilities and balance. Long-term rehabilitation is often the only way to recover, as completely as possible, these lost skills. To be effective, this type of rehabilitation should follow three main rules. First, rehabilitation exercises should be able to keep patient's motivation high. Second, each exercise should be customizable depending on patient's needs. Third, patient's performance should be evaluated objectively, i.e., by measuring patient's movements with respect to an optimal reference model. To meet the just reported requirements, in this paper, an interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework for the generation of 3D immersive serious games is proposed. The framework combines two Natural User Interfaces (NUIs), for hand and body modeling, respectively, and a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to provide the patient with an interactive and highly defined Virtual Environment (VE) for playing with stimulating rehabilitation exercises.

30327596,Effects of Combined Physical and Cognitive Virtual Reality-Based Training on Cognitive Impairment and Oxidative Stress in MCI Patients: A Pilot Study.,kelly-2018,1,1.0,,"The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group.

22768793,"Reaching out, inviting back: using Interactive voice response (IVR) technology to recycle relapsed smokers back to Quitline treatment--a randomized controlled trial.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco dependence is a chronic, relapsing condition that typically requires multiple quit attempts and extended treatment. When offered the opportunity, relapsed smokers are interested in recycling back into treatment for a new, assisted quit attempt. This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of interactive voice response (IVR) in recycling low income smokers who had previously used quitline (QL) support back to QL support for a new quit attempt. METHODS: A sample of 2985 previous QL callers were randomized to either receive IVR screening for current smoking (control group) or IVR screening plus an IVR intervention. The IVR intervention consists of automated questions to identify and address barriers to re-cycling in QL support, followed by an offer to be transferred to the QL and reinitiate treatment. Re-enrollment in QL services for both groups was documented. RESULTS: The IVR system successfully reached 715 (23.9%) former QL participants. Of those, 27% (194/715) reported to the IVR system that they had quit smoking and were therefore excluded from the study and analysis. The trial's final sample was composed of 521 current smokers. The re-enrollment rate was 3.3% for the control group and 28.2% for the intervention group (p < .001). Logistic regression results indicated an 11.2 times higher odds for re-enrollment of the intervention group than the control group (p < .001). Results did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, or level of education, however recycled smokers were older (Mean = 45.2; SD = 11.7) than smokers who declined a new treatment cycle (Mean = 41.8; SD = 13.2); (p = 0.013). The main barriers reported for not engaging in a new treatment cycle were low self-efficacy and lack of interest in quitting. After delivering IVR messages targeting these reported barriers, 32% of the smokers reporting low self-efficacy and 4.8% of those reporting lack of interest in quitting re-engaged in a new QL treatment cycle. CONCLUSION: Proactive IVR outreach is a promising tool to engage low income, relapsed smokers back into a new cycle of treatment. Integration of IVR intervention for recycling smokers with previous QL treatment has the potential to decrease tobacco-related disparities.

24597650,A task-specific interactive game-based virtual reality rehabilitation system for patients with stroke: a usability test and two clinical experiments.,molina-2014,1,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster���, a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. METHODS: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded. RESULTS: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P = .03) and MBI (P = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (P = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were reported.

30415751,"Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii Fit PlusTM for frail older adults: A randomized feasibility clinical trial.",kelly-2018,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Recently, interactive video games (IVGs) have been used as a health-care intervention that provides both exercise and cognitive stimulation. Several studies have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ (NWFP) interactive video games, and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and (5) fear of falling (FES-I). RESULTS: Participants in the EG improved their scores in all 10 games, reported that they understood and enjoyed the tasks of the games, and presented few adverse events during the practice. There was a significant improvement in the Mini-BESTest and Functional Gait Assessment in the EG when compared with the CG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of NWFP was feasible, acceptable, and safe for frail older adults and improved their postural control and gait. There were no effects on cognition, mood, or fear of falling.

The Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale [McAuley, E., Courneya, K., 1994. The Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale (SEES): development and preliminary validation. Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology 16, 163-177] was used to measure positive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [Spielberger, C.D., Gorsuch, R., Lushene, R., 1970. Manual for the State-trait Anxiety Inventory. Consulting Psychologists, Palo Alto] to measure state and trait anxiety respectively. Correlational analyses, between the various measures taken postdance, showed that the overall set of relations between the SEES subscales and the SAI-Y1 subscale supports the criterion-related validity of this measure of exercise-induced psychological responses. The independent groups t-tests showed that the control group in comparison to experimental group, at rest as well as on the second measurement, has significantly higher levels of state anxiety (t=-4.45, p<0.001 &t=-6.56, p<0.001), psychological distress (t=-4.30, p<0.001 &t=-5.46, p<0.001), and fatigue (t=-3.16, p<0.01 &t=-3.46, p<0.001), while it has significantly lower levels of positive well-being (t=4.23, p<0.001 &t=6.90, p<0.001). After dancing approximately 63% of maximum heart rate of experimental group was activated, while from paired t-tests significant decreases in state anxiety (t=5.02, p<0.001) and psychological distress (t=3.14, p<0.01) were observed, as well as significant increases in positive well-being (t=-4.44, p<0.001) and fatigue (t=-2.15, p<0.05).

METHODS: We included 70 patients (36 for study, 34 as control) with a chronic imbalance problem caused by uncompensated Ménière's disease. The virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation comprised four training tasks (modified Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises: eye, head, extension, and coordination exercises) performed in six training sessions (in 4 weeks). Measurements of the task scores and balance parameters obtained at the baseline and after final training sessions were compared. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in extension and coordination scores. Patients in the early stages of Ménière's disease had a significantly greater improvement in the center of gravity sway and trajectory excursion in the mediolateral direction than did patients in the late stages of Ménière's disease.

A hundred and eleven subjects (75 women and 36 men) 60-91 years old, were divided into an experimental group (n=76) which participated in Greek traditional dances and a control group (n=35) which was discussing and watching television, both for 1h. The Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale [McAuley, E., Courneya, K., 1994. The Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale (SEES): development and preliminary validation. Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology 16, 163-177] was used to measure positive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [Spielberger, C.D., Gorsuch, R., Lushene, R., 1970.

28264717,Mobile Exergaming for Health-Effects of a serious game application for smartphones on physical activity and exercise adherence in type 2 diabetes mellitus-study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Exergaming is a novel approach to increase motivation for regular physical activity (PA) among sedentary individuals such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because existing exergames do not offer fitness-level adjusted, individualized workouts and are normally stationary (TV bound), thus not enabling PA anywhere and at any time, we developed a smartphone-based, game-like software application (MOBIGAME) specifically designed for middle-aged T2DM patients to induce a healthier, more active lifestyle as part of successful T2DM treatment and management. In a randomized controlled trial we aim to examine whether our smartphone-based game application can lead to increases in daily PA in T2DM patients that are persistent in the mid to long term and whether these increases are greater than those in a control group. METHODS: This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 42 T2DM patients [45-70 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, low daily PA, regular smartphone use]. The experimental intervention (duration 24 weeks) includes individualized multidimensional home-based exercise and daily PA promotion administered through MOBIGAME. The control intervention consists of a one-time standard lifestyle counseling including the promotion of baseline activities. The primary outcome is daily PA measured as steps per day. Secondary outcome is exercise adherence measured via the usage data from the participants' smartphones (experimental intervention) and as self-recorded exercise log entries (control intervention). We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control group with respect to post-interventional daily PA (as well as all other outcomes) using analysis of covariance. For each analysis, an estimate (with 95% confidence interval) of the difference in outcome between both groups will be reported. DISCUSSION: This research will investigate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based, game-like software application to be used as a way to promote regular daily PA among inactive T2DM patients. The results of this trial may have important implications for future PA-promoting interventions and provide relevant information for the general transferability of such applications to be used as part of the treatment in other chronic diseases.

27317506,Changing Behavioral Lifestyle Risk Factors Related to Cognitive Decline in Later Life Using a Self-Motivated eHealth Intervention in Dutch Adults.,molina-2014,0,1.0,,"BACKGROUND: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults. METHODS: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage. RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95% CI 0.49-1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components. CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.

27418422,"Three-dimensional, virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation for chronic imbalance problem caused by Ménière's disease: a pilot study.",molina-2014,1,,1.0,"PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a three-dimensional, virtual reality system for vestibular rehabilitation in patients with intractable Ménière's disease and chronic vestibular dysfunction. METHODS: We included 70 patients (36 for study, 34 as control) with a chronic imbalance problem caused by uncompensated Ménière's disease. The virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation comprised four training tasks (modified Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises: eye, head, extension, and coordination exercises) performed in six training sessions (in 4 weeks). Measurements of the task scores and balance parameters obtained at the baseline and after final training sessions were compared. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in extension and coordination scores. Patients in the early stages of Ménière's disease had a significantly greater improvement in the center of gravity sway and trajectory excursion in the mediolateral direction than did patients in the late stages of Ménière's disease. Mild functional disability attributable to Ménière's disease was a predictor of improvement in the statokinesigram and maximum trajectory excursion in the anteroposterior direction after rehabilitation. The control group showed no significant improvement in almost all parameters. CONCLUSION: Virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation may be useful in patients with Ménière's disease, particular those in the early stages or having mild functional disability.
